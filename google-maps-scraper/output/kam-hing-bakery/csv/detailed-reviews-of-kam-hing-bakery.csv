But then again, some people call it legendary sponge cakes. I am completely down for legendary sponge cakes! So off we went. It is a bit of hall in a wall type of place, you will miss it if you are not paying attention. The inside was small, plain, simple, no-frills. They do offer more than the legendary sponge cakes, like hot dishes and other baked goods, and coffee & tea of course. The infamous sponge cakes are in a plastic bin right underneath the cash register counter. They have the Original and few other flavored kinds. I hear the sponge cakes here are really popular, and that they get sold out quickly. We went there on a very snowy day, so we didnt have any issue getting what we wanted. It is always good to visit popular spot on a bad weather day. We got original, mint chocolate chip, and green tea sponge cake. They were really fluffy and airy, just as it was described by many of their fans. It was egg-y, sweet but not much, really light. As light as clouds. It is a simple sponge cake, but has that comfort flavor that reminds me of home-cooked or -baked feel to it. I see why their sponge cakes are popular. Very fluffy and light, and the flavored kinds have really strong flavors present in it. And the price, you cant beat the value. Super cheap!
