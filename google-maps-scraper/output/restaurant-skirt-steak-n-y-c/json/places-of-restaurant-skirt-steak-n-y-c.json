We were seated at the bar and were promised that we would be moved as soon as something became available. But that was no longer necessary: I have rarely sat so well at a high table. The bartender was very friendly and gave us good recommendations! We noticed that the boss was very present, which may have been because we were sitting at the bar. The food was great!!! Likewise for drinks, the wait was worth it! We would come back anytime! Thanks for a yummy evening! Great stuff! Thank you so much!!",

The meat was tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The side dishes were equally delicious and elevated the overall dining experience.

                "review_text": "Last night, my daughter and I ventured off to NYC and had dinner at Skirt Steak in the Flat Iron district. My daughter has been wanting to go here for some time after seeing it on TikTok. She s a steak lover and I love French fries so this place combined the best of both worlds. Skirt Steak had gone viral for its prix fixe menu where you order your 6oz skirt steak to your liking; well, medium well, medium or rare. This is accompanied by a salad with a little olive based dressing, and unlimited fries for $45. Other than fries, they do offer other sides which are limited: Scalloped potatoes with cheese & bacon and broccoli. Their sides are $12 additional and are ever changing, so expect something different if you go. They also offer an assortment of desserts for $12 as well. The beverage menu was a little limited that started at about $6. Overall the ambiance of the restaurant was quaint and intimate. If you go, expect a line at the door and the waiting time may average about 15 to 20 minutes depending on the size of your party. I was satisfied and I enjoyed my experience. My daughter and I order our skirt steaks medium which was served with a bearnaise sauce. In addition to the salad and unlimited French fries we order the potatoes smothered with cheese & bacon. I ordered a regular margarita which was pretty strong and my daughter ordered a Diet Coke. We also ordered dessert. I ordered a chocolate cake with icing and my daughter ordered the bloody orange tart. My chocolate cake was underwhelming but my daughter s dessert tasted like fruit loops  I really liked the tart. I didn t know what to expect since my daughter picked it but we both enjoyed our dinner experience at Skirt Steak. This is the place for you if you love red meat  there are NO other protein options. It s a pretty straightforward and to the point menu without the frills. I highly recommend getting your steak prepared medium as it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely return. I give it a 9/10",

I sat at the bar and was greeted promptly by the bartender. I was started off with a field greens salad that had a light tart dressing and a strong flavor from fresh dill. The steak comes at 3 temperatures; rare, medium, or well. I went with the rare. The steak was cooked perfectly to rare and had wonderful taste. The bearnaise sauce was the beat Ive had in a long time. Rich and smooth, on the thinner side as it should be. The fries were a perfect thin and crunchy shoe string style. The fries are unlimited, and I was asked if I wanted a refill, which I appreciated. Honestly, youre not going to beat the value. For what youre paying vs. the quality of food. I really feel like you win here. Highly recommended and will be back again. Vegetarian options: None. Parking: Garages in the area. Limited street parking.",

Service was attentive, though it does feel rushed but the premise is likely to turn or flip the tables as often as possible-understandable.

So medium is nice cooked with a pink juicy center. Their side options are great, I definitely recommend their spinach, you also have the option to upgrade to garlic bread instead of plain.

The girl managing the queue asked us one at a time if we wanted to sit on the counter and skip the queue instead of waiting for the table to become free. Top, this is how you treat the customer. We preferred to wait for the table but still waited very little (about 15 minutes). Once inside I appreciated the style of the place and the order in the furnishings (it seems like a superior place). We were immediately brought a drink and a nice plate of salad while the host showed us the restaurants fixed dish, and yes! Because the local formula is: 1. A plate of salad served immediately 2. A cut of beef cooked to your needs. 3. All you can it chips. The meat was very soft, the salad non-trivial and the chips crunchy (but I add a little too salty). Optimal. The bill was fair for how we were treated and for what we ate (about 100 dollars for two), but considering that very famous places in NY charge you 30 dollars for a toast  we can say that it is a fair price. Well done.",

Top, e cosi che si tratta il cliente. Abbiamo preferito attendere il tavolo ma comunque abbiamo aspettato davvero poco (circa 15 minuti). Una volta dentro ho apprezzato lo stile del locale e lordine nellarredamento (sembra un locale superiore). Ci e stata portato subito da bere e una bel piatto di insalata mentre il camere ci illustrava il piatto fisso del locale, e si! Perche la formula de locale e: 1. Un piatto di insalata servito subito 2. Una tagliata di manzo cotta secondo le proprie esigenze. 3. Patatine all you can it. La carne era morbidissima, linsalata non banale e le patatine croccanti (ma aggiungo un po troppo salate). Ottimo. Il conto e stato giusto per come siamo stati trattati e per quello che abbiamo mangiato (circa 100 dollari in due), ma considerando che famosissimi locali a NY ti spillano 30 dollari per un toast  possiamo dire che e un prezzo onesto.

The fries are unlimited so that definitely helps to get you filling fuller. The place is huge and its so pretty and cozy inside. All in all we would return and recommend it.

Please eat at this restaurant! The server from Senegal who speaks French was extremely personable and kind! The rest of the staff was so nice and catered to anything my family and I wanted.

The steak had too much burnt pepper on it, and the salad wasnt enjoyable. The waitress didnt disclose the portion size of the side dish, which was very big, so we ended up  sending back the side untouched. Returning the steak was PERFECT, and Im really picky with steak. The salad dressing tasted better, and the fried were still yummy. The cocktails are pretty standard for NYC overpriced drinks. I havent had dessert from there since Im always full after the meal.

I was laughed at by her, but after I stood still, some people started to join the queue. The steak was delicious. The salad dressing was a bit sour. The bread was buttered and delicious. The salt on the fries was not very even. We were salty until we finished. The clerk would push the dessert cabinet and visit the tables. The cakes all looked delicious. We ordered lemon. /The lime pie is delicious but it costs $12. I think we ordered it because of the atmosphere.",

I remembered this resturant because of the hype it got on Instagram. The IG reviews lived up to the hype. The decor was beautiful and ambient. The food was amazing. From the salad to the dessert was great. The garlic bread was to die for. The only downfall was that I found a hair in my unlimited fries however, management Did right by me. The Concord grape cheesecake is absolutely phenomenal it is a MUST GO!",

Note they will only cook steaks to rare, medium, or well--no half-donenesses. I picked medium (I would usually order medium-rare) and it was perfectly medium with a great char. My friend, who also usually orders medium-rare, went for rare, and she was absolutely delighted, but I wouldve found it too rare for me. The mustardy sauce that comes with the steak is utterly delicious on the steak as well as the fries (they charge you if you want extra of that, though!). Fries were great, and two helpings was certainly more than enough.",

They try to give a giant load on your plate right away as can be seen and also if you ask for more you may have to be on it for just a small scoop more so if you did again want more they will be tastier. Loved the sauce with the steak and even more with the fries. Get the garlic bread, its extra for it, normally just regular bread comes with the meal I believe but so worth it. Salad was much bigger than expected too. Beautiful deserts to top",

The host kindly let us sit down at a table to wait for our family (as the bar was not   accessible to her) We sat down and the first waiter asked what type of water we wanted. The other waiter arrived with the bottle of San Pellegrino and I was on the video chat with my family trying to find out if they were they were. The waiter then slammed the bottle down in the middle of the table and I m not sure why, but it upset me. The other waiter was rushing us to order even though my family had not arrived yet. So I ordered a glass of wine. Our server Sarah made up for the awkward  moments before. Sarah was kind and direct. Our order did get messed up (medium vs rare) honestly it s not that big of a deal to me. I enjoyed the simplicity of the entrees, very clean and tasty. Wasn t in love with the fries and they were pushing those fries. The interiors design is calm and sharp Scandinavian with an intelligent layout. I think the only thing that turned me off was this pretentious vibes going on for just  a down to earth salad, steak and fries. I don t know if the pompous attitude is suppose to makes the food taste better  or it s their secret sauce. But that was my experience and I had to work the rest of the evening to adjust my attitude. One of the waiters did warm up later . So    .",

The steak was juicy and flavorful with a nice herbal/spice sauce (not spicy) to dip or to pour. The fries were perfect crispy and perfectly salted and always came out nice and hot. The steak in the picture is 2 for two people, for portion referencing. There is only one dish on the menu for $45 wish is the steak and unlimited fries as well as a wonderful salad with a vinegary dressing that was so delicious and light along with a side of bread with butter. They  also have sides and we tried the sauteed spinach which was so well seasoned and flavorful. We also tried the Key Lime Pie Martini ($16) which seemed kind of pricey for the really small glass that you get but it was really good and sweet! The sweetened ice tea tasted fresh. The Key Lime Pie on the dessert cart tasted so good and satisfied my sweet tooth! Overall I definitely recommend eating here for a nice steak dinner the atmosphere is beautiful and calm.",

Limited menu: Everyone starts with a small basket of fresh hard bread, and a small (6-8oz) piece of skirt steak (fattiest and tastiest part of the cow, and cheapest), and a heaping bowl of iceberg lettuce with amazing light vinegarette/shallot dressing, and string French fries (which they keep bringing you). You have to eat a lot of French fries or youll leave hungry. The ambiance is great, like youre in a cow shed. At $39 per person, Not counting drinks or extras (only Mexican corn or Brussels available or desert)...its not worth the price.",

The salad is just a plate of huge uncut pieces of lettuce with mint and a dressing. We paid $170 for fries.

Not sure I would go back. Including a soft drink and a desert (shared) ended up at $65 per person. For a simple Sunday lunch, it felt a bit overpriced for what you get.

There is no menu and you have to make a decision directly at the table from the service staff. Very loud, so its not easy to understand everything acoustically... Overall, our dining experience was partly very good and partly not so good: There is only a pre-fixed menu with two price ranges ($39 or $69). You dont find out anything about the origin or weight of the steak in question... it tasted good, although it didnt contain much meat, but the worry of eating the cheapest hormonal meat clouded my joy (I didnt find out). Sauce, green salad and fries were super good! Ive rarely eaten such good fries, these are available with any second helping... The dessert, a strawberry cake, however, was expensive and had no flavor whatsoever. Side dish spinach (extra $12) very salty. I found the service unpleasantly pushy and condescending, and using the credit card not at the table but in a secluded corner wasnt ideal either. My conclusion: because of service and unclear origin: information about the food 1-2 points deducted.. In total",

Man erfahrt nichts uber Herkunft und Gewicht des jeweiligen Steaks  geschmacklich war es gut, wenngleich wenig Fleisch, aber die Sorge billigstes Hormonfleisch zu essen hat meine Freude getrubt (ich hab es nicht herausgefunden). Sauce, gruner Salat und Pommes waren mega gut ! Selten hab ich so gute Pommes gegessen, diese gibt es mit beliebigen Nachschlag Das Dessert, eine Erdbeertorte hingegen teuer und ohne irgendeine Geschmacksrichtung. Side Dish Spinat (extra 12$) sehr salzig. Den Service fand ich unangenehm pushy und herablassend, Kreditkarte nicht am Tisch, sondern in einer uneinsehbaren Ecke zu verwenden auch nicht optimal.

The skirt steak was tender and juicy, cooked to a perfect medium rare as I requested. The bearnaise sauce added a rich and creamy touch, while the field greens balanced out the heaviness of the meat. The fries were crispy and hot, and I loved that they kept refilling them without me having to ask. The service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was lively and warm.Skirt Steak is a great place to enjoy a simple but satisfying meal at a reasonable price. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves steak and fries.",

At Skirt Steak it literally just one main on the menu, in this case skirt steak, unlimited fries, bread basket, and salad, for $39. It is beautiful. After a long day and you dont want to make a bunch more decisions, its super refreshing. How do you want it cooked, what do you want to drink, thats it. Theres also a handle full of rotating sides as well as garlic bread you can add on, though the main event is usually more than enough. The atmosphere is also great and calming, nicely lit and all unstained wood. Feels causal, elegant, and fun, with almost a high end pop up vibe. They dont take reservations, which in this case is a big benefit, as I know I can always go last minute when I have a craving for steak or forgot to make a reservation for something else. May take a little while, youll often see a long line at busy times, but it tends to move pretty quick. Likely as everyone there sits down and simply says... Medium Rare, Manhattan please, and yes on the garlic bread... Highly recommend",

When we set our cc down 2 people were completely all over our table leaning and I mean leaning into our table of 3 to clear it. The steaks were fatty and not seasoned well but cooked perfectly, fries salad garlic bread and ratatouille were good not great.",

We also got the ratatouille which was a great addition because it helped with the very over powering charcoal flavor from the steak. I got the rare and medium steak both had a strong charcoal flavor. The fries were warm and the salad was random sizes of chopped lettuce with vinegar. The service was really great and super attentive but the food just simple wasn t worth going back for. Maybe if you really cover all the steak in the small side of sauce does it take away some of the charcoal but even then there s easily better places to eat. It s was a funny environment and the dessert all looks great.",

I ve had better skirt steak in the Bronx for $10. It seems like a deal for all you are getting, but I can assure you you can much more bang for your buck in the Bronx, flushing, or even LES. Paid 70 for garlic bread, the main course, water and desert. Paid the exact same price at TAO downtown for even more food of different flavors which is 1000% better than what I had today. This place is a scam, just another nyc tourist place and if you are a tourist, there are better tourist food places to try.  Even 7th street burger tastes better.",

I think that there is an issue with the management, because when we entered there was about 10 empty tables and they didn t seat people, which leads to make the waiting time longer and longer The menu was very basic, for the people whom are familiar with entrecote. But with no comparison. The steak that I got was burned with a black crust instead of (well done)!! Not recommended at all, don t waste your time and wait in the line.",

There was always such a long line outside I was kind of intimidated to go. however, a friend and I were supposed to go somewhere else in the area but when we got there it didnt smells great in there and opted to go here. I enjoyed the steak, pretty normal, tender. Id try the more expensive option on the next go round just to have comparison. I didnt even get to take a picture of the fries or the steak because I was too husy eating and talking     which is great! The house was good, kind of tastes like kombacha(if thats how you spell it   ) and thats okay for me, I liked it. The fries are truly unlimited, and that is awesome for a fry connoisseur. 2 people, 3 non alcoholic beverages $105 wasnt too bad. I had a good time.",

We also tried some items off their dessert cart, which was pretty good.  Nice setting, and attentive staff, so overall a great experience.

The simple menu concept for me is great, but they have some ad ons that are kind of pushed through to you by the staff. This is what happened to us. The waitresses asked if we wanted the bacon fries without explaining to is that our meal had already fries included, and they were not the same. We ended up with too much food in front of us, what went to waste.",

If you go for the bare-bones prixe fix of steak frites, salad, and tack on a beverage, you get one helluva bargain with top-notch quality you typically dont get at that price. That said at Skirt Steak you want to go for the side of the day and dessert trolley (the latter of which I need to do next time. Both cost a little extra but the quality of everything here makes it--as I said earlier--worth every penny. I dont recall if the garlic bread is available every day but it was really good--perfect for soaking up the bottom of the salad plate and a delicious thing in itself while the salad was a nice and light contrast to everything else. The steak was cooked to my requested doneness (rare) and was great on its own. The sauce it came with added another level of flavor while the fries helped me mop up leftover sauce and steak juices. Overall a great meal. Definitely recommend you try at least once.",

Honestly, my boyfriend has made better skirt steaks than this one his first try making it for us. My boyfriend can make a steak. I know what great steak is. This place is all hype. They served the skirt steak cold. It tasted like charcoal and no flavor. We got there 5:35 pm and we were seated by 5.46 pm yesterday 01/20/23. They open at 5. They had people waiting on line when you can visibly see 4, 5 tables open. They are purposely trying to make it appear that there is a line and that they are busy to build their restaurant hype. Its all for show. The inside is decorated with cheap ply wood. I would never come back here and stick to my three go to spots that Ive named above which I highly recommend. The fries are basically soggy McDonalds fries (McDonalds fries are good to me, taste wise). They french fries are unlimited. They do give free salad and hard bread. I honestly came here because my boyfriend and I like cheap eats. This place was not that cheap and not good. 84 bucks for cold charcoal skirt steak, fries, salad and hard bread. The waiters were nice, but it felt like they were rushing to get you out of there. I will never come back here.",

Be aware that you might be seated next to an uncontrolled child. $39+ tip is over doing it by A LOT.  The set came with bread, salad, fries, and 1/2 a steak. The bread was baked too long and crunched like croutons. If you like it CRUNCHY, this is for you. The salad was a quality salad. I loved the fries. I have a suspicion that it was fried in tallow. My steak was medium like I asked for. In all the pictures, Ive seen 2 stacks. In the picture I took of my own meal, there was one stack. At this price point, I would have dined at Fogo de Chao instead.",

They said there are only three options for steak doneness: rare, medium, or well done (no medium rare) so we ordered medium and they came out medium rare (Im wasnt mad!). Fries are great. Iced tea was lovely and fragrant. Desserts were awesome--try the mango passion fruit mousse! Kid-friendliness: You can sub a burger for the steak and get it plain without fried onions or anything, but there are no other options for kids--they have to get the prix fixe. I wouldnt recommend this place unless your kid really likes steak or burgers and has a healthy appetite.",

We waiting in line for about an hour. The salad was very disappointing. It was just romaine lettuce and dressing. Not even a single tomato or carrot or anything. The salad had very huge chunks of lettuce and it seems like the didn t even cut it, it looked like it was peeled off the wedge. The steak and fries was tasty but I was hoping for a bigger portion of steak. Skirt steak is one of the cheapest cuts, and I could ve easily killed a portion for 4. Unlimited fries are a good idea, but there s only so much fries a person can eat and that s how they get you. The house dessert (lime cheesecake) was tasty, but the chocolate cake tasted like boxed cake. The staff was very nice and welcoming.",

Meanwhile the garlic bread and salad were nothing noteworthy. On a positive note, the fries were well cooked and the margaritas were nice. Staff was very respectful & vibe was cozy. Its fair to say they sell the sizzle and not the steak there. Dont fall for the IG/TikTok hype.",

The salad was not it; lovely presentation but the dressing they used is extremely bitter and I didnt like it at all. We got Iced Tea, very refreshing and a slice of multi-tiered chocolate cake that was pretty good too. We also got the garlic bread, very rubbery, not all the rave.

The menu is uniquely brief and to the point. You have the choice of perfectly prepared skirt steak (served with nicely dressed butter greens salad and an unlimited amount of frites). All you have to decide is the level of doneness for your skirt steak. We ordered medium for the table, and we were delighted with the outcome. We forwent the dessert offerings and instead happily finished our fries. FYI, as per the recommendation of several friends, we visited during brunch time on a Sunday to avoid long wait lines and crowds. I am looking forward to returning soon.",

The steak had good flavor and was juicy. The fries are fried in peanut oil, but I couldn t try them because of allergies, so I was disappointed.

But the main event is very good. The skirt steak is cooked to perfection and the sauce that comes on the side was also incredibly good. The starter salad was a wonderful mix of different greens and very fresh and vibrant. I would loke to try again..but sticking to only the steak and fries. On a side note...our water was very attentive and actually took one of the desserts off the bill when my wife mentioned it wasnt what she was expecting. All in all a good time out.",

                "review_text": "Summary: good concept almost carbon-copied from French restaurant chain Relais de LEntrecote- and notably misses the mark on key elements. The Good: Overall, the restaurant decor, service, and food were top tier. Our server was Larissa, and we felt very much that we were well waited on throughout the night! For a Thursday night, we waited ~20 minutes, which I thought was perfect for a bustling restaurant. The ambience felt very warm and welcoming, and I loved the wooden columns and decor. The dessert selection was also excellent and very much on par with other NYC restaurants. The Not Good: Frankly, Im only giving this restaurant 3 stars because, as a concept, Relais de LEntrecote does it better. Charging $2 for extra Bearnaise felt very slimy, and felt like the restaurant was being stingy rather than willing to get people to try their linchpin ingredient that ties the steak and fries together. Relais also serves 2 portions of steak initially, then follows up with another portion of steak - meanwhile, Skirt Steak only serves the initial two portions (perfectly cooked, I recommend rare here), then does not allow for further portions. That second portion makes all the difference at the other restaurant, as it helps keep you satisfied in your appetite- here, I wanted more, but all I had were fries with no sauce and no meat :(. Other minor points are to add salt and pepper to the table - I actually wanted the salt for the fries, not the meat, but it felt trite to have to ask for these condiments at a steak restaurant of all places, where there will be a vast range of steak preferences from different patrons. Generally speaking, I really liked this place, and wanted it to succeed- it is succeeding too! I just know that other places with a very similar premise have features that make the dining experience there that much more satisfying. Keep up the good work, and I hope some of my critique takes root.",

Not sure if the quality has just gone down over the last year or if the 25 minutes on the train messed up my meal or what, but it was not the same meal I remembered. The steak portion was small and my  medium  steak was very, very tough. The bearnaise was far too thick and the fries were soggy and seemingly unsalted. Definitely a bummer. Their sit-down experience is probably the way to go anyway and I ll give that another shot someday. but definitely will not get takeout from here again and would not recommend it.",

The fries were slightly overdone and I feel like the oil needed to be changed. However, they have potential to be perfect. For dessert we had the Black Forrest cake and it was delicious.

Though meals can be fast as they have the service down, I didnt feel rushed. If I was going to the theater I would definitely consider catching dinner at Skirt Steak!",

We all had been wanting  to try this place for a while and that day was the day. So, a long line outside should be a good indicator, but once we were seated, the waiter gave us only the drunk list and start telling us in speed of a roadrunner of all items on the menu, not offering any other menu, not trying to tell us to look at the board above our table. Was he expecting us to remember the 1st item he mentioned when he finished his 15th items? Hellll no. He tried to upsell and maybe trying to use the confusion strategy to get peoplenot, mostly are tourists, to nod...get $$$$. Most importantly, if he had to talk that much trying to upset his items, he should have worn a mask. I know its not mandatory anymore for COVID. But there are other things beside COVID that come with the saliva. ....thats to me was the 1st red flag. So, we ended up getting their basic set. It started with the salad. A generous amount of salad which was unedible. We all had a bit or two and we put our fork down. It didnt look fresh. My husband and our friend said it was bitter. I said the veggies look old and the salad dressing is horrible. When the meat came with fries, the meat portion was smaller than what we expected, not like Les Venise steak house on Lexington. The fries was oily. So, we just finished the meat, paid and leave. Beside food, my husband ordered a coke, they brought Diet Coke. I normally would order an alcoholic drink and dessert when dinning out, but not this time. I dont feel like giving more money to support the poor services. I would give a 3 stars to one of the food runner...he did a great job in serving us and he should be promoted as a main waiter.",

My ONLY criticism is that they precut your steak into large chunks, but the chunks are cut along the grain instead of across, which would have made it easier to slice into bite sized pieces and a more tender chew.",

It was savory but unfortunately to hard to chew. Salad was a healthy option, seasoned with only light vinaigrette dressing. Overall beautiful experience here at skirt steak. Thank you for having me",

My husband and I live in Queens but we went to Manhattan just to try this place that got rave reviews.  We returned and arrived about 10 minutes before opening and although there was a line, we were in the first group to fill this small restaurant.  The menu is very limited - including steak, fries, heirloom tomato salad, salad and corn on the cobb.  The fries are unlimited.  They offered 2 kinds of steak.  One $30 and the premium steak at $60.  I am very particular about my steak being tender, so I ordered the $60 steak. It was very good.  The pricing was reasonable and the service was fast, efficient and friendly.   I would recommend this place to a friend.",

Drinks and desserts are available at additional cost of course. Saw this place while searching for a late dinner spot and decided to give this place a try. Didnt have to queue for long at 8:30pm and got a table pretty soon. Service wise, there are dedicated staff to take your orders, or to serve you food, so even if the staff passed by who is free, they wont entertain you. Food wise, the salad was normal. Would love to have some variety of vegetables instead of all greens, and even the sauce for salad. Skirt Steak was medium done as requested, charred on the outside and pretty much medium rare inside. This is probably my first time trying the skirt part of the steak so the taste was pretty good. Each portion of skirt steak comes with a small serving of sauce and $2 additional if you ask for more. The fries were nothing much to talk about. Its basically fries. Overall, its a casual place for dinner, do come at a later time to get a table easily, but the staff will kinda clear your table as soon as they can. As an overseas tourist myself, I guess its something different to experience in Skirt Steak.",

Started off with a salad that personally I was not a fan of (it has fennel & anise on top, wish someone told me). The steak was great! The flavor and temperature were perfect & the bearnaise sauce was a nice touch. Fries, c mon, who doesn t love UNLIMITED fries!? I will say that some were more well done then others but they were still delicious. 9 out of 10 would go back for more!",

After objecting and getting inside, I tried to wait at the bar to get a drink and was told I could not.  The bar seats were for dinning guests that may come in . Again, restaurant was mostly empty. So Bizarre. Had me stand next to her at door. Companion arrives, we sit down, order, GIANT BUG IN SALAD. SO. GROSS. Not a fly nor nat; this was a big winged beetle. Clearly lettuce is not properly washed here. No thank you on a replacement salad Server was gracious, totally not their fault. But manager never came over to apologize or ask how to make it right. Strange for a well established restaurant group. Manhattan cocktail served warm. They brought an ice cube over as the supposed solve. Garlic bread overpriced (same as the table bread then overcooked crunchy with bit of herb/garlic). Steak: 1 medium and 1 rare served the same temp, couldn t tell the difference. PS they charge for extra sauce; Le Relais de lEntrecot is happy to pour it on. Additional fries not offered until steak was finished. No thanks. Poor imitation nock off with unfinished plywood walls in an attempt to be trendy? Hard pass. Dinner beware.",

As there really is no menu you get your salad served immediately and steak comes a few minutes later.  Steak was good and portion was OK leaving you wanting more.  The fries are endless and nice and crispy but we did have to flag people down to get more instead of having the staff looking who wanted more.  Dessert is a cart which is not included in price and changes fast so if you see something you like get it as they may run out by the end of your dinner. I would go back as it was a nice quick bite and this is how this is designed.  This is not a full menu restaurant and we knew that going there so were not disappointed.",

He said everyone gets the same thing the $30 steak and whatever else comes with it. So that s what we ordered. I did have the watermelon shrub. Which was amazing( non-alcoholic) and the strawberry shrub(also amazing) but prefer the watermelon. The salad came first and it wasn t good to me. I don t really like vinaigrette. So yea.. the  guy brought out the steak and fries. Filled my plate with fries, which also wasn t good to me. I get that the fries are unlimited but yo  they are over cooked he didn t need to pile them on my plate like that and I kinda was hinting it was enough the first moment he started. The steak was cool. They only cook steak three ways. Rare, medium, and well. We got ours medium. It was cooked good but wasn t to crazy about it. I could cook some better steak than that. It d definitely taste better too!",

The person who brought the dessert cart was busy selling desserts and was not interested in the birthday candles. It would be better if the service was a little bit better, but for the price, I have no complaints.",

Steak definitely didn t deserve the 33 dollar charge and staff needs more training on listening to their customers. Very unhappy!!!",

Our party of 5 was plucked from the line ahead of other couples and we were seated inside. They showed a preference for bigger parties and the restaurant was busy. Efficient service with a good range of drinks. We had cocktails & beers, all were excellent. We ordered some sides with our steaks but they never arrived, the steaks an adequate size and were tender and tasty. The desert trolley rolled around and offered a good selection and we all enjoyed our choices. The only issue with our visit was that we were overcharged on the bill when it was entered by  our server after we left. It was noticed a few days later on our credit card statement and after 2 emails was corrected with an apology by the restaurant. Worth a visit to this reasonably priced restaurant with a never ending serve of fries! Please note that once you have finished your meal you are reminded that you need to leave.",

Steak tasted like they were dragged through a sand of salt, no other flavors hit your taste buds. (The homemade sauce tasted like a watered-down ranch dressing) Biggest let down is they dont even give you a full sized serving of a steak. They give you chopped up small 6 peices. The fries? Dipped and drenched in a bucket of oil and salt, dont joke about it being average size either. Well below average in quality. We ordered the truffle fries. They were basically regular fries with sprinkles of whatever the heck they added on it that tasted like more salt. Bottomless bucket is an illusionary market tactic, non of us got a second serving. Because why? Salty, oily, flavorless, and your conscious will hit you too if youre health consciousness. The good? Bartender made strong drinks. The desserts were phenomenal.",

Garlic bread is available for $10. Waiter will then explain their steak is cooked either three ways Med, Med Rare, Rare. Steak comes out hot and accompanied with a  house made sauce similar to Au Piovre. Fries are unlimited and are piled high once the steak reaches the table. Ketchup, Mayo, and Mustard are your three condiment choices. Additional sides are available for $10 each. Drinks were decent I did the spiced margarita . Once entree is finished dessert is offered via a cart at $10. After filling up with Steak and Fries I had to pass on dessert.  Over all great experience. Reservations are not accepted so be prepared to wait as there is always a line down the block. I suggest arriving around 430pm as they open at 5pm for first seating.",

A plain flank steak costs $28, which is a bargain in New York City, which is probably why people were willing to wait for a table. Luckily, our total time waiting in line was about 15 minutes because we volunteered for the seats at the bar. The menus are quite simple. You order the steak and they give you unlimited salad and fries. Optionally, you can order other side dishes such as fries or spinach. We ordered a regular flank steak ($28) and the Wagyu ($56) for both of us. This restaurant doesn t take reservations for small parties, when my partner arrived there around 5:20 PM there was already a line out of the door.

Waited an unreasonable amount of time in the cold for entry, for a great $28 steak and fries deal. No coke for my daughter, eager waiter sent someone to the store! Nice but he got diet, with what the response  you looked like a diet girl  whaaaa? Nope. Ordered coke! The cocktail I ordered  got report back like 10 minutes later, bar didn t have the ingredients to make  you have the ability to upgrade bread to a buttery garlicky version  they didn t have  you have the ability to add on scrumptious sides from a feature list (I think it may change seasonally) doesn t matter, they ran out! Not to mention the meal was just okay. Fries were definitely on point, but I may have had a general taste of disgust from the disappointment in my mouth. I d be willing to chalk it up as a bad night  maybe give it a go during a less busy time. But for now just okay at best was my experience  Waiter while eager to please, was a bit of a bug, and then MIA when we needed/wanted him. Again I may have been too annoyed to appreciate anything! The dessert truck was a really neat and exciting treat when it came rolling around to us  too bad they didn t have what were hoping to order. Bummer.",

Then the desserts came around in a cart and looked beautiful. The key lime pie was great as for the flan it has some sort of a butterscotch topping which made it almost made it inedible  because it was wild sweet. I m not sure why someone would add that to a flan since it s already super sweet. As for drinks I had the spritzer and that was great.

The food was overall fine. The fries were by far the best part - in fact they were really good, but they never came by with a refill as they said they would. The steak was fine. The salad would have been good, but the salad dressing felt grainy for some reason? It also needs to be said that it felt like there was a very large charge for everything. No drinks were free, including water - 12 dollars for a liter bottle. A side of tator tots was 10 dollars. Getting your complimentary bread upgraded to garlic bread was 10 dollars... there seemed to be a way of upgrading everything. Overall it was a fine experience, but I personally think there are better places in the city to spend your money.",

We got an indoor table which was nice but now the problems start: 4 people at a table and they only sent a basket with 1 bread, the same amount they send for a table with 1 or 2 people, and when we asked for more the waiter said it would be extra $4 it didnt make sense! According to the amount of meat was less than what they advertise, I ordered it well done and it came burnt, the potatoes were burnt too. The waiter almost didnt come to the table and when we asked for the bill he took exactly 30 minutes to collect and whenever he was going to leave something on the table he literally threw it and left. I dont recommend it and it was a terrible experience!",

IG failed me on this one.",

When the other server served the fried he put for both of us ( we told him that we ordered one only ) immediately after that the first server came and said you ordered one fries only with an impolite way .. we told him it s not our fault and we told him that we ordered one.

Also either they put a seasoning in it or they don t wash it properly as I was crunching on what looked and seemed like dirt. The only thing that was very good was the potato with cheese and bacon. Other then that, spending $175 I d rather cook food at home and make a better steak or go to a few different locations.",

The thick sauce definitely helped to add flavor.Salad was decent. The fries could ve been better. More than 90% the fries were extra crispy and simply crumbs ,Like the left over fries you don t eat. You will end up leaving hungry unless you order 2 orders of steak for one person. Or you will end up leaving with your stomach feeling inside out. Might as well go to Applebees,Not worth the hype. But was it all worth it at the end with the service, food, how you feel after leaving. Na I don t think so. I also observed some unusual behavior with staff . A man was staring at my child up and down as we were leaving . Disgusting",

You get a green salad which is just lettuce no toppings, mixed in their dressing. No option for another. The steak was a little burnt which gave it that burnt taste. No good. It was also chewy. The fries looked soggy but they were pretty good. We also got one side order of the potatoes with cheese and bacon. The potatoes were hard. But the cheese was amazing. For drink, I got the blueberry spritz, that was delicious. As for service, they did come around a few times but forgot our silverware which didn t come until after we received our food. And the food took about 30 mins to come out which I thought was crazy since there s only one thing in the menu. Not a place I will be going back to.",

The wait was about 30 mins and we were finally seated. I would love to speak on the service It was great! The overall staff  are friendly and pleasant. They re not overbearing or inauthentic at all. We had the pleasure of being served by Kat, who was a complete doll. Another server by the name of Melissa came to check on us as well and she was quite pleasant as well. The food was delicious! It was well worth the $28 dollars to me. The steak was delicious, the fries were good and the garlic bread was satisfying. The only thing I wish this place would do is allow reservations for smaller parties because the waiting can be a bit draining, but I m thankful that we didn t wait long! I definitely recommend this place!",

They do one thing, and they do it well   the skirt steak was delicious. The fries are those skinny fries that were cooked to perfect crispness with just the right amount of salt. I ate more of those than planned! We tried an upgraded bread for the table ($10, garlic bread), and in the future, we d skip that option. Not because it wasn t tasty, because it was, but because with that plus the small starter salad (simple, with a nice, light dressing) and the main course, it was quite a bit of food (ended up bringing the remainder of my steak home). Would definitely go again.",

Actually, the long line of people waiting to dine in is the most prominent feature of this restaurant and I myself had been wondering what is there that keeps people waiting for so long. Now, I can say its not worth the wait. Steak itself was not tender, however the waitress offered a better cut at 2x price, but we went on with regular one that comes with fries and salad at $28. Salad was good but fries were too oily and not crunchy. Food and wait aside, the staff were so friendly and they provided a really nice service.",

My friends and I came in at around 12 on a Saturday, as they do not accept reservations. We didnt have to wait but it was pretty packed at that time already. For drinks, I had the blackberry spritz, which wasnt bad. Fruity but not too sweet. The skirt steak ($28) comes with a side of au poivre (probably?) sauce, a salad, and unlimited fries. There are only three doneness options: well done, medium well, or rare. I usually get medium rare so I opted for the rare, which pretty much was like medium rare. The steak was pretty salty and chewy. It was kind of disappointing. The fries looked soggy but they actually taste better than it looks. The best part of the meal was probably the salad. Its a butter lettuce salad, though they were a bit heavy handed on the dressing. The steak looks small but I was struggling to finish towards the end, probably because 1. I ate a bunch of fries 2. Again, the steak was salty. Overall, it was okay for what it was but I probably wouldnt come back.",

Cons: 1hr line minimum, small serving of steak, fries were okay Honestly food was pretty decent, steak was good not great imo. The pictures attached was for 2 servings. I was expecting more, but also understand considering the price. Fries were inconsistent, one batch was unsalted and I had to ask for salt, the next batch seemed to come from the depths of the ocean and I was shaking some off. Pros: Staff is very attentive and professional, has a real valuable steakhouse feel. Vibe is fun, people are in good spirits. Cant go wrong with $28 steak and fries. They dont let you go empty on the fries(in a nice way.) Staff is quick to grab empty plates and very friendly. Overall, I may have rated higher if I didnt go into it expecting more from all the hype build up and a 1hr+ long line. Just doesnt seem worth it for another visit.",

                "review_text": "I was very excited to dine here. The reviews seemed great. First off, there is NO two hour wait. On Saturday and Sunday the restaurant opens for brunch (same menu, with the addition of garlic bread for $12, and no option for bottomless drinks). The hours on those days are 11:30a-3p and the reopen at 5pm until closing (10/11p). Therefore, people made it during 3-5p and decided themselves to wait. Moving on. This was my second time here because of that. Our table had bread crumbs on it and the paper placemats had an oil stain. The waitress dusted it off but we had to ask the bus boy to replace the paper. Underneath had more crumbs and dirt and he threw the new mat over it. Unacceptable. Next, we were told buy a manager there was no Prosecco but the waitress said there was. When it was brought to the table it was flatter than fast food soda. Unacceptable. The server really tries to upcharge by selling you on $10 sides. But the food comes with 2 sides- my personal opinion is just to offer substitutions or $1 upcharge to switch it because you still get the salad + fries + extra side(s). My biggest issue was that this restaurant use PEANUT OIL to fry their fries AND you dont know until you ask. In a world full of allergies this should be readily disclosed. Unacceptable. *Disclamer- all the desserts, with the exception of the Chocolate cake, are made with NUTS* The meat is served Med Rare, Medium, and Well Done. What also went wrong was that 4 orders of meat came out severely undercooked when we asked for Medium. At this point I was turned off and no longer hungry. Our waitress started off very friendly but soon didnt show up to our table at all. The manager Savaah stopped by the table was was extremely personable. He spoke with us a little and apologized for the experience and welcomed us to dine their again in hopes we would change our minds. Because of his visit to the table and his generous offers we reconsidered. However, after reviewing it with my party we probably will not, not based on the experience but based on the food quality itself. The portion size for one is a 4-6 oz steak, a licorice flavored salad, and cold + burnt fries. Savaah has increased my star review, and I sincerely thank you, but ultimately I would not recommend this restaurant. Pictures to follow.",

The steak, while cooked perfectly rare with a nice char, had that nasty acrid flavor from using lighter fluid (or quick light charcoal) to speed up the process, instead of letting the charcoal burn properly until its ready. This flavor was very overpowering and really detracted from our enjoyment of the meal. The unlimited fries were very good, and the salad was better than we were expecting. My wifes $16 glass of Pinot Noir tasted awful, like a cheap $3 bottle. But my dirty martini was perfect. The garlic bread at a $10 upsell was super stale and hard, but thankfully the waitress took it off the bill when requested.",

We ordered 4 mediums and 1 rare, what we received was a hodge-podge of raw to medium-well, sometimes within one portion.  The waiter kindly offered to take some of the raw pieces back.  That sauce was tasty, and necessary to season the otherwise bland skirt steak. 2. The unlimited fries - so disappointing.  Overcooked and cold.  After the second refill of dry cold fries, we asked for a new batch, and the waiter finally brought us some hot fries. 3.  Dessert- key lime pie, with an unnecessary but,very dramatic looking, fluff tasting meringue was okay.  Thin slice of desserts not worth the $10 go to a local bakery instead. 4. Sides - never received the sides we ordered to yeah that happened. 5. Drinks - again save your money.  The non-alcoholic Cranberry Rosemary drink is simple syrup and seltzer with a tablespoon of cranberry juice. Another $10 wasted. 6.  Overall atmosphere- People literally kept their coats on because it was so cold.  Either this was done on purpose or a malfunctioning hvac system, either was it was horribly cold and drafty. The concept is great for marketing, but actual execution really missed the mark.  The waiters and staff are super friendly and pretty efficient considering the capacity crowd, but the kitchen is going to tank this place if they don t get the quality control together.",

                "review_text": "Absolutely one of the best deals ever. The regular deal is $28 for salad, steak, and unlimited fries but for a $30 supplement you can get their wagyu which is, undoubtedly, the best for the price. They switch up their wagyu from day to day depending on the quality, sometimes it s Australian, sometimes it s Japanese. Maybe there s more but I ve never tried anything else. Not sure why people say they re rushed, because the staff is always super accommodating. But at the same time, you re eating steak and fries and you know there s a line. Pay it forward and don t be that guy that spends 2 hours at a popular place, it s not like you re going to tip 100% They come around the line and ask for whoever wants bar seating, so it s a great way to skip the line and get a seating earlier. Bartenders are great, and a single pour of Macallan 12 is $18 for a 2oz pour which is absolutely amazing. Let me tell you, this place is not just Tik Tok famous. Chef Laurent Tourondel knocked it out of the park with this concept of a single item menu. Also, if you don t already, follow their social media accounts. The Instagram account stories are absolutely hilarious. All in all, so worth.",

However, the normal steak is quite small and not that good, the fries were over cooked and oily, and the salad had a bitter taste to it. We paid for the upgraded wagyu steak, which tasted far better but cost $60 (for comparisson, you can have a full meal at Cote, a Michelin stared Korean bbq resturant, for $55). Not worth the price. We also tried the garlic bread which was as hard as a rock. Also, they do not take reservations, and most nights the minimum wait will be ~1 hour. Wanted to try it so we sucked it up and waited, but it wasn t worth it. With regards to the resturant itself, the inside of the resturant is very nicely designed and the staff are friendly.

Our waitress came and we ordered a side of spinach and garlic bread, which was a bit small for what you paid for but fine. The steak was a fine, a bit burnt but passable. Where we had issues was with service because the servers would ask my guest if she was done with her food and then proceed to take my food as well although I literally had fork in hand. They had also asked if we would like a refill on fries but they never came back to provide the fries. Finally servers/busboys came back shortly after and started to take our food again taking only a half eaten spinach side, this time without asking at all. Honestly the whole experience started to feel very rushed at the end and felt like they were kicking us out. Food is good for the price but with its current popularity mixed with ok service think you are better waiting until the popularity dies down a bit before going to visit. This was my second visit, the first was during opening week and service was significantly better. If you want a true steakhouse service and experience, I definitely suggest visiting a traditional steakhouse instead.",

Even if we were able to walk in I would have been very dissatisfied. Salad was extremely bitter, although some might like that. I ordered my steak medium, my fiance ordered hers rare. Hers was more cooked on the outside than mine, and when i say cooked i mean charred to a crisp. The only way to get a steak that burnt on the outside and that rare inside is to not clean pans between steaks. Hers tasted like absolute dirt. Mine was almost edible. Would not recommend to anyone",

They brought us the salad to start which were chunks of uncut lettuce drenched in a lemon vinaigrette dressing. The steak amount was small for two and came VERY charred/ burned. Almost unable to eat. The unlimited fries were EXTREMELY salted and not fresh. Our dining experience was rushed and lasted maybe 30 minutes. This place is not worth waiting for to be rushed out. In addition, we ordered desert and it tasted as if it were out all day. A disappointing experience. This restaurant values quantity of people over quality of food.",

Steak and fries, seems easy right? The fries are classically prepared and they re done very well. To compare them to McDonalds well please by all means return to your scope of culinary expertise. For those of you criticizing the sauce options A) BBQ sauce does not belong on fries or these steaks B) Peppercorn Bearnaise - if you re not saucing your steak with it or dipping your fries in it, then do you even know what good food is? I ve been fortunate enough to dine here multiple times, and each time I am welcomed back by a perfectly executed rare steak, hot fries, refreshing salad, and a smiling and engaging team from the front of the house. Kudos to the kitchen team for nothing short of a miracle. And to the folks who left poor reviews, it s clear you re the same people who have never worked in retail or hospitality and certainly don t know good food.",

We both got the regular meal (salad, skirt steak, and fries), and we also shared a slice of cheesecake for dessert. Everything was of good quality and everything tasted great as well. For the price of $28 per person before dessert, I think this place is totally worth it, and worth the trade off of having to wait in line. Will definitely be recommending to my friends.",

                "review_text": "First off, I want to say that this place is fun! The service is amazing, staff are fun, and the decor is homely and cute - the vibes are impeccable! Now for the food - I want to say that for the price of $28, the fixed meal does seem like a good deal. However, to start, they already give you a large portion of fries. Chances of you getting seconds for the bottomless fry deal are low, and if you did, youd probably say something like oh, just a little bit please. The steak itself is quite a small portion. In my pictures, unfortunately I was too hungry and forgot to take it before I started eating... but as you see on the hot plate, there are two spots of meat. Those were (before we began eating) two separate portions. Make of that what you will. Sides and dessert are extra charge, which is expected. For $28, the meal will definitely fill you up, just not necessarily on the steak. I love the sauce they serve with the steak, and the steak itself is cooked beautifully. I do want to mention though that as a whole, the meal was extremely salty for me. The seasonings are heavy - be it the salad, fries, or steak. The sides that we ordered, such as the Spinach gratin and potato/bacon side were also extremely salty. The only break I had was taking enormous gulps of water. The dessert on the other hand was wonderful.  Not too sweet, but still rich enough to make me feel like I was indulging in a dessert. I ordered the citrus cheesecake. I want to say that this place is worth the experience. The food is good and so is the atmosphere. Staff are so so friendly. However, if youre looking for a larger quantity of steak and perhaps just less of a sodium blast in general, you might as well buy a nice cut of ribeye or whatever you prefer, cook it up at home, and season to your liking. To me, it isnt worth waiting out in the cold for several hours like other reviews had mentioned. I arrived on a Thursday 20 minutes before opening and was seated promptly. While Im glad I tried out the place and joined the hype train for a sec, I probably wont be coming again unless their menu gets an update.",

If you are solo, ask for bar seats u might be able to get seated quicker. They don t take reservation unless it s party of 7 and up. You don t put ur name down anywhere bc there is no list, u just need to stand in line with ur complete party and inch up the line slowly. When u are next in line at the door, someone from inside will open the door and assist.  U will see many ppl trying to storm in to the hostess stand behind the door to put their name down, but the manager has his system in control and pushes back these ppl to go back in the line. It s definitely worth it, $28 u get a beautiful classic green salad w/ mixed herbs and vinaigrette, the skirt steak is served on a cast iron skillet with some kind of brown sauce (does not taste like peppercorn sauce), temp of the steak was well executed, juicy and a little bit of a biTe since it s skirt steak, the char from the grill was exactly what I was looking for, they served the unlimited fries from a big bowl, the server was walking around the dining room offering fries refill. Ambience was great, lively and bustling, interior design looks like a cedar wood chalet which is a bit of a disconnect imo. There were sides of the day available for around $10-$12, and we ordered the spinach gratin which was great! I heard some days they have potato gratin as an option too. Dessert was from a gueridon cart, some classic cakes and they all looked really good, we tried the chocolate tart and it was good. Service was tip top, friendly, attentive, professional and hands on. Must visit and will definitely return. Great job to the team!",

                "review_text": "Came into Skirt Steak on a Wednesday night. Party of four and we waited around a half an hour. The hostess was nice and got us seated relatively quickly. When we sat, we were greeted by our waiter. It was explained to us that there are three ways to cook the steak, either rare, medium, or well done - and that the meal comes with unlimited fries and salad to start. He brought us some still water and asked us if wed like bread to start - he said yes. When we were brought the bread, there were 6 pieces for 4 people. Not to mention the fact that nobody ever mentioned wed be charged $10 for BREAD. I thought this was an extremely predatory sales tactic, but whatever. Then, the salads came. Everybody at the table had salad that was way too bitter to eat. At first, we thought it was the dressing, but after asking for another salad with the dressing on the side, we noticed the lettuce was inedible - it was too bitter to eat. Upon further inspection, we noticed that the lettuce had to have been spoiled. As a waiter of 3 years myself, I have never heard one account of lettuce being spoiled or bitter  Then, we asked for an order of bread for the table and again were given not even enough for 4 people to eat two slices of bread. When we asked for more, we were told wed be charged, even though we were charged the $10 for the bread initially AND we didnt eat any salad. Not to mention the fact that they dont have any salad dressing OTHER than ONE SINGLE vinaigrette, or the fact that the only real dipping sauce they have for their unlimited fries is ketchup, mayo, and siracha. Almost $40 a person without the dessert and I cant eat my fries with BBQ sauce or my salad with caesar dressing. Next, the meat was brought. The only highlight of the meal and the only reason Im giving this experience a two star. I was very upset because I asked for my meat medium, and more on the pink side if possible, and the waiter just nodded his head and never made sure my meat was pink. The unlimited fries that came with my meal became cold within seconds - indicating that fries were not fresh. On top of everything, during sitting for a 2-hour meal, our fries were replenished twice. The meat was OKAY. Nothing to write home about, but at least I got something filling that I could eat throughout all of this. On top of everything, our waiter checked on us once after getting our orders - thats it. We were served primarily by the busboys. I wish I could say this was the end of my experience, but it wasnt. We asked to split the bill four ways and the waiter told me that the machine doesnt do this. I dont understand how thats possible? As someone who has operated an OS responsible for a restaurant, and as someone who has easily split checks 3 ways - I knew this was a lie. The waiter did not attempt to be helpful at all, and instead insisted we only give him 2 cards. I understand that running a restaurant costs money, but when youre paying $5 for a slim glass of Coca-Cola that PERHAPS houses a half a can, or when youre charging $10 for bread [unheard of], at least make sure your computers [in 2022] are capable of paying checks. The funniest part to me is that the waiter came up to the table with his hands behind his back, asked us if we were ready for the check, and when we said yes, he pulled the check out and handed it to us - absolutely rushing to get us out of the restaurant to flip the table. Lets recount my experience: -30 minute wait, inedible salad, predatory sales tactics [selling bread for $10?], no real help from my waiter, meat not cooked to my liking, the only time the waiter showed us any real attention was to get his tip, no sauces, no dressings other than ONE shallot vinagrette At least the fries were good though, right? This place needs a lot of work.",

The $28 meal is a fair buy for whats included, you will definitely not leave feeling hungry with the unlimited fries/$10 appetizers offered. The dessert cart is just the cherry on top, I had the French pastry and chocolate cake. I would go for the French pastry as the chocolate cake wasn t too special. What I loved the most was everything tasted fresh. The meat was absolutely delicious, and the unlimited fries were always served HOT. One thing, I would not recommend is the American wagu. Very fatty delicious but it does not top the steak served with the $28 meal. Give it a try, it s a nice vibe for date night. I recommend  showing up 1hr to 30 mins before 5pm and be prepared to stand in a line!",

We had the $28 Skirt Steak and unlimited fries, 1 mixed drink, garlic bread, Sunnyside eggs, and desert and it came out to $70 per person. The fries were great, while the inside of the steak was perfectly cooked the outside was burnt and definitely smelled and tasted that way. The steak is also cooked without salt and pepper but the Bearnise sauce served on the side makes up for this. Garlic bread was good and the dessert was amazing, try the Blood Orange Cheesecake our party really enjoyed it.",

We went for dinner on a Saturday night, and they dont take reservations we aimed for 6PM and a friend got there earlier and in total we ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs to be seated, and this is after we jumped at the chance for bar seats over a table. As for the value at $29 for the pre-fixe salad, skirt steak and all you can eat fries it is amazing. Also, for a steak house I was surprised by the beer selection, it was not generic and was quite nice. However, the good for me ends there ... First, the steak... It was alight but in my opinion just lacked flavor even with the bechamel sauce they provided I felt myself wanting more. I probably would have covered it in A1 if they offered it, that is how little flavor it had. As for the fries they were ok but were nothing to write home about. The extra sides they had ranged from $10-$12 but have to admit they were quite small, we got Brussel Sprouts, Spinach and Cauliflower Gratin. The best one was the Cauliflower by far, the sprouts were ok and the spinach I could have done without. Overall for NYC it is a great value and if half stars were an option I would have given in 3.5.",

The Garlic    Bread   is also a delicious   appetizer but costs an extra $10! The desserts   are unbelievable - we had three: the chocolate   cake  , chocolate tart, and hazelnut   pastry  ! They come a la carte and cost $10 each. Staff    is super friendly and service is super professional! The ambience   is wonderful and the interior design is beautiful.

When we requested for more fries the bar tender told us they had run out of fries due to the shortage of fries they will be closing early tonight. Although, the people seated next to me were given more fries when i asked they ran out. The coke was 5 dollars filled majority of just ice.

Seated very quickly upon arrival and ordered a skirt martini with an El Dorado and Coke. Both were very strong and just what the doctor ordered. My only  complaint  would be that some pieces of the lettuce in my salad were a bit harder than others. Steak was ordered medium and cooked to perfection. Juicy inside and the right bit of char on the outside. The sauce on the side was heavenly. Sides of garlic bread and the cheese potatoes were excellent accompaniments to the meal. Fries served were nicely salted and cooked (exactly how all French restaurants serve their fries; if you re looking for overly crispy, overly salty fries, go elsewhere, that s not the way they re supposed to be done anyway). The desserts were also extremely tasty. The flan was the winner. My wife had the banana tiramisu, but wishes she had gotten the flan. Overall, a nice little gem right in the city. Will definitely repeat. Don t hesitate and don t let the other reviews scare you off, not sure where those people went, but it wasn t here.",

                "review_text": "Unlimited fries. Now I have your attention, Skirt Steak offers a high-quality dinner at an affordable price. The entree selection is reduced to one item and the dining experience is friendly and efficient. This isnt the Gallaghers or Keens steakhouse treatment, but youll leave Skirt Steak content and happy. Detailed review below: Skirt Steak first presented me an interior gabled with a barn like framing bathed in warm light. Inviting and friendly are both the aesthetic and the staff. When walking to my table there was an energy in the air as other diners ate, conversed, and enjoyed their meal. Great ambiance. The table was adorned with neatly folded napkins nestling card stock menus. Utensils and cups befittingly positioned. The surface was covered in a paper place setting with the words: Greens, Skirt Steak, Fries / $28 stamped on the corners. This simple mantra is the basis of simple elegance. I glanced once again around the room and appreciated the rustic design. Even the speakers were made of light-colored wood to match the framing. Their menu is clean and easy to read with a spartan grouping of wines, beer, cocktails, and dessert. The wine and beer arrays are diverse enough to satisfy most palates while the cocktail selection offers riffs on a few classics. The titular Skirt Steak is offered in only three temperatures: rare, medium, and well. I ordered a Skirt Manhattan and a rare steak with spinach. Bread arrived before the meal with soft spreadable butter. The bread had a firm crust with a soft interior while the butter was rich and salted. The Skirt Manhattan was textbook; spirit forward with just enough vermouth to cut the harshness of the whiskey. The default green of the meal was a small salad of raw leafy veggies with herbs and a marinade. It tasted of fennel and dill drizzled with olive oil and a dash of lemon. I must say the salad is underrated. It brought a freshness to the experience and prepared me for the heavier main course. The steak was crusted on the exterior and served sliced on a griddle exposing the pink center. Fries were thin, crispy, and well salted. On its own, the steak was properly seasoned and the combination of the textures was lovely. There was a sauce which appeared to be bearnaise served on the side. I can only describe the sauce as culinary napalm as it was so viscous it could stick to anything and make it fire. Spinach was tender and flavorful. Unlimited fries sounds amazing but in the big picture the meal is so complete the unlimited fries are more of a novelty than a necessity. The star of the dinner was the dessert. I did not expect to be blown away as I do not have a sweet tooth but when the dessert cart rolled to the table, I knew I was in for a treat. The elaborate glass and wood chest matched the rustic aesthetic of the restaurant and emitted an aura as if it was the arc of the covenant. My table ordered a few pastries. The flan is the best Ive ever had, I still yearn for the chocolate tart with berries, and the paris-brest was delicate and decadent. My only complaint with both the desert and the restaurant is that they did not serve coffee. Seems like an unfortunate oversight as coffee would have enhanced the wonderful dessert. Overall skirt steak delivers a high-quality meal at an affordable price with excellent service in a relaxed yet stylish atmosphere. Five stars.",

We paid $52 for what turned out to be an $18 bottle of wine. The sides and deserts also add up easily, but the bread is decently worthwhile. The price doesn t make this worth it for more than a novelty, and while it s a fun atmosphere and  trending,  it s not a place you come back to. The steak was cooked to the correct temperature, but there was no caramelized crust, just a burnt layer. Fries were great however, no complaints. If however they started doing reservations, bettered their steak cooking, and reworked the alcohol menu to be based at least vaguely in reality, it could be a great occasional place to bring an out of town friend.",

                "review_text": "Master of One Its better to have one item on the menu done perfectly than to have a large menu of poorly executed dishes. I present to you @skirtsteak.nyc, the eponymously named restaurant known for serving only Skirt steak. There is only 1 thing on their menu which is conveniently printed on the left hand corner of table. $28 for the full course menu. Consisting of a field green salad, skirt steak and endless handmade fries. Upon being seated the waiter took our drink order and gave us a basket of bread, which was great. It had a crunchy crust with fluffy soft inside that paired great with butter. It was simply great bread. The field green salad is adequate, its a salad. The greens are fresh and earthy/herby in flavor, I cant remember if there was dressing but then again this is a salad at a steak restaurant its not suppose to be memorable. I managed to finish it, my brother did not. The skirt steak, the star of the show, arrived shortly after we were done with our salads. And cooked perfectly to the temperature requested (medium rare). The outside had a nice sear and the overall steak was extremely flavorful and tender. I didnt know skirt steak would be done this well. It is also served with like a garlic butter sauce, I tried a piece with the sauce but honestly it wasnt needed. The steak is great on it own. Instead use that sauce for the endless fries. The endless fries are served alongside the steak and yes its truly endless, as soon as you empty the bowl they bring a refill, until you ask them to stop. And the fries are also top-notch; crispy and fresh. So good that we had 3 refills. The menu also has a changng number of  daily sides ($9) that waiter will introduce. We went with the cauliflower gratin which was just a cheesy cauliflower delight! And last and certainly not least they have an amazing dessert cart that gets pushed out after you finish and do yourself a favor, order dessert. I had this amazing hazelnut flavor dream of a dessert and I forget what my brother ordered. I wish I could remember the name of it but instead I used that limited space in my memory to just remember that taste of that dessert. If you are ever in NYC; Do yourself a favor, go. **this review is of my dining experience from November 24th, 2021**",

My waitress offered garlic bread and worded it in such a way that my friends and I thought it was free, when in fact its $9 per loaf (a short baguette like bread that was filled with some garlic-buttery pesto). The steak was great as expected but the fries were nothing spectacular of McDonalds fries. The server of the fries (some guy who walks around with a bowl of fries and tongs) spilled fries in my glass of water, and I was never offered a new cup. Desert was served a la carte and too was vastly overpriced as each item is either $9-$10, of course there was no mention from the servers of the price as they expect you to remember them from the little menu-pamphlet I was given 45 minutes ago. I decided to get the carrot cake and it tasted like your average store bought slice. All in all I feel that the $47 (tax+tip included) I spent for the prixe fixe and the garlic bread + cake I split with my friends was not worth the experience.",

Fries (as a bonus) are unlimited for anyone that is still hungry after pairing their steak with a decadent and complementary bearnaise sauce. And, for anyone still finding themselves wanting, a dessert cart will find its way to you, with unmissable offerings including a creamy flan and paris-brest. The conceit here is simple and proves itself as an intelligent twist on a traditional steak experience, at a price mostly anyone can afford. Don t miss this spot!",

My first time at Skirt was within the first month of opening and it was great.  The service, drinks and food were good and its tough to beat a decent steak that comes with salad and unlimited fries for $28. Decided to stop by again for a low-key dinner on my birthday and man this place has changed.  All of the decently separated tables are reserved for influencers and friends of the owner and large groups.  I would completely understand that if those tables were full to begin with.  That was not the case at all last night. Our dinner lasted about an hour and a half and the influencer tables were only half booked the entire time we were there so we were pretty annoyed that we were denied a decent empty table. This place clearly has not been able to handle the hype its gotten over social media. The host staff seemed wildly unprepared to organize a walk-in only restaurant.  They were constantly flustered and did not seat first come, first serve as walk-in restaurants usually do.  Not their fault. The food is decent but I wont go out of my way to return anytime soon.",

I love everything about this restaurant - its simple, straight forward, and couldnt ask for more! (but you can always get more fries!) For a great value you start with a greens salad. Followed by a nice size steak and then a server comes around with a hot bowl of fresh french fries which are also unlimited! Bar had a selection of well prices wines and of course delcious martinis. My favorite part is the rolling dessert cart! This glass chariot of goodies passes you at eye level while your eating certainly reminds you to save room for something tasty. A great way to elevate service to select an array of classic desserts like carrot cake and chocolate cake, a nice nod to classic steakhouses. All presented tableside, like a rasberry or chocolate sauced poured at the table.",

Then when seated the waiter did not even approach us and was more worried about the other tables tipping him since they were paying. One of the workers noticed and decided to serve us himself and bless him he was the nicest and most caring person! Glad that it got turned around. We ended up getting complementary cocktails and they were both very nice. You pay $28 and there s only skirt steak on the menu with unlimited fries. The skirt steak was cooked to perfection and the fries were unlimited and delicious, you also get salad and bread. After that there s a dessert cart with many options. We tried the key lime pie and loved it. Overall food 10/10 but they have to work on some of the workers and the lines outside.",

We unfortunately cannot control the line or peoples interest in dining with us, especially after the TikTok coverage, but we are sorry you had to spend time in line. However, we are looking into digital wait lists to help during winter months. We are not intending on taking reservations at this time, and we offer our tables based on what party sizes we can accommodate. If a party of 4 opens up, we ask for the next party of 4 in line to come in. This is the same with bar seating and parties of two. As for the team, we are continuously working to improve service, and we will absolutely look into what happened during your experience. Best regards, The Skirt Steak Team",

The steak is a cheap cut, not surprising given the price, but it was still disappointing. The waitstaff were friendly enough, but lacked attention. At no point we were asked if we would like an additional drink, only water on arrival. It then took far too long to bring the cheque over to us, and then take payment from that point. The main grievance is that after 90 minutes of waiting, we did not feel we got a satisfactory dining experience. To those waiting in line, I would suggest they go elsewhere if the queue is too long.",

My husband and I arrived around 6pm and didn t get in till 8pm due to the long line down the block (be prepared for that). Despite the long line we had a great time. Upon entering you are greeted, seated and immediately get service which was great. The food came out so fast and was delicious! We both got well done steak with the fries and garlic bread (a must have). Service was great and the dessert cart was also a plus! You definitely get a great value for the price. I would certainly recommend giving it a try.",

                "review_text": "Had an awesome meal at Skirt Steak last night! I had seen this restaurant via a viral TikTok and it definitely lived up to the hype. We got there around 7:30 on a Monday and had to wait just under an hour to get in. Once you sit down, you re presented with a drink menu, but no food menu it s printed on your table! $28 for bread, salad, skirt steak, and unlimited fries. It s an awesome deal and you won t leave hungry. The salad was large and had a delicious dressing, and was served with fresh baguette and butter. Ask for the garlic bread (if they still have any they tend to run out as the night goes on). After salad, they bring over your steak, which can be cooked rare, medium, or well done (we found the medium to be closest to medium rare, if that s what you re looking for). The skirt steak is served with a really great sauce as well as unlimited French fries (they ll come around and ask you if you want more!) For anyone that isn t familiar with skirt steak, it s become increasingly popular (and expensive) over the past few years and is prized for its tenderness and great flavor. You can also get a side of some vegetables (they had spinach and Brussels sprouts when we went, the spinach was great), though that s an additional charge on top of the base $28. Super friendly service and it seems like they re just as excited as the customers about what they re doing, made for a great experience. Couldn t recommend this place more and I ll definitely be back!",

Since I would normally order Med-Well, the server recommended the Well, as it would still have a little red. Well, it did not - in fact, it was charred. But no worries, our server promptly put in an order for Medium and it came out perfect. Unlimited fries and a salad accompanied the main dish, but you can also order spinach or brussles. A great price point and package for under 30$, but you can definitely run up the tab with drinks and dessert. Great drinks. Service was a little spotty due to an influx in patrons - likely from viewing a viral tiktok video (which is how I found the place).",

As soon as I walked in I was told there was a 15 minute wait, even through the restaurant was half empty and all but two of the 20+ bar seats were open. When I asked if I could just sit at the bar, they hedged back and forth and finally said yes. I learned this would soon be a consistent approach as I was sat by the door, overhearing others come in. Each person coming in was given wildly different answers as they came in. The red-headed bartender (never shared her name) was initially alone behind the bar, so we cut her some slack. However absolute disinterest was the only thing she served us without an exorbitant wait. Were talking 20+ minutes for a requested water refill. We ordered our food after sitting there more than 30 minutes, and bread and salad came pretty quickly. Standard, boring, Golden Corral level of fare. It then took over 45 minutes after the salads to get out steaks. I finally asked the bartender because two people that had come in an hour after us got their food first. She went to the kitchen, and clearly our steaks had been given to others at the bar. The steak itself was cooked well temperature wise for medium. It was crusted with so much salt, I assume to try and tenderize it, that it was nearly inedible. The fries were hit or miss, with half of them being oily and soggy. If youre only going to offer three things on your menu, you need to execute them perfectly. Save yourself some mediocrity, un-like this on TikTok, and get a good steak frites somewhere else.",

Our first server asked what we wanted to drink and how we wanted our steaks cooked. Rare, medium or well was all they offer we were told. After she took our order she never came back, there was many different people coming to our table so we did not have the same person serving us. A family got seated behind us a little while later and had a manager taking their order I think, and he was explaining that there was other side dishes & an option of a burger? Our server only asked us how we want the steak cooked and never mentioned anything else. Everyone seems all over the place and just unsure. Dessert cart is a great idea, never seen anything like it. Was too full to get dessert but it also threw me off seeing that dessert was 9$? Could be wrong but I think that s what I saw on the mini menu of alcohol. Not sure why a small sliver of carrot cake is the same price as Paris Brest. Needs improvement but the steak and fries were delish",

In addition to the steak, fries, and salad, we added on the garlic bread ($9) and two desserts (key lime pie and chocolate mouse for $9 each) and would recommend all three. Blackberry spritz was good but they were out of the spices for the spiced margarita so I ordered a regular margarita which I would not recommend. We arrived at around 4:30pm (on a Friday) and there was no line so we took a walk around the block. When we came back at around 4:45, a line had started to form and it grew quickly. We were seated around 5:15 or so which wasn t bad at all but I can t imagine being at the end of that line as it obviously moved slower once the tables filled up. So definitely go early if you want to avoid a long wait as the line was even longer when we left. (They don t take reservations for parties under seven people). While we enjoyed the food, they would need to sort out some of the service issues before we return. Our server was nice (no complaints there) but we had to wait close to 30+ minutes for them to refill the fries at our table and by the time they had brought the second round of fries, my steak was then cold. A bit frustrating as they mentioned that the fries were unlimited several times while seating us etc. As a new restaurant, it is understandable that they are working out some of the kinks in the service but I would have appreciated some communication that there was a delay in the kitchen instead of just avoiding our table like they did.",

I was told that it came with a salad, the steak and unlimited fries. So I ordered.. a  spiced margarita , not good! It didn t taste nothing like a margarita.. a couple sat next to me n were told about sides, different drinks I didn t see in the menu and even a burger.. why wasn t I told all that!? The fries are unlimited! The guy was passing by giving everyone double and even thirds He pass me by several times and didn t care to bring me some. I finally got his attention and he brought me ice instead of fries. I said May I get more fries. MORE !! And lastly another guy was passing by offering dessert to the tables. And guess what ?? Yup! I wasn t offered dessert. I was dressed presentable, makeup looked nice, I table manners. I wonder what it was that made me different to not deserve the same treat As everyone else.",

As the name says, they serve skirt steak, but don t leave your vegetarian/vegan friends at home, because they also have an option of cauliflower steak that was absolutely delicious. The cauliflower steak was a large portion, excellently cooked with a bearnaise sauce, mushrooms, watercress, and seasoned well to bring all the flavors together (you can ask to have it without the bearnaise if you are vegan). This comes with bread, a green salad that had a delightful dressing, as well as bottomless shoestring fries. The servers come around with fresh fries all the time and you can have as much as you want. All of this for $28. Sides, drinks, and desserts are extra. I opted for the sauteed spinach, which was also very good. The desserts looked beautiful, but I was so full that I didn t get any this time.",

The bar part is very lovely, bar tender service was on point, delicious drinks. Very  simple and organic decor. Bathroom is not well designed and inconvenient, for example, the can for feminine care products is under the sink which is hard to reach. My complaint was about the hostess and waiter communication & service. When we walked in, we specifically asked if we two could get a table for just drinks as we d like to have some room for our winter coats and a bday cake we just picked up nearby. We were led to a small table by the kitchen. The dining room was very very empty. Sat down and ordered drinks. While we were enjoying our drinks, waiter came over to take the dinner order. We politely listened to the dinner menu and told him we were here only for drinks. 2 mins later a manager look person came over and told us to move to the bar, said tables only reserved for dinner guests. And we were basically escorted to the bar immediately. For a busy dinner time, I would have no problem, wouldn t even try to ask for a table. But for a empty dining room like that, and a heads up was given when we walked in, that s just a joke.",

The steak was nicely charred on the outside yet remained perfectly tender. We were convinced to order the Paris-Brest for dessert and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. My only complaint is that they tried pushing drinks on us too much, but otherwise the service was top notch.",

Service is extremely quick and all the staff is extremely friendly. The atmosphere is very inviting and the entire restaurant feels very open and pleasant. The beer list is quite varied and feels curated quite well to pair with the meal. The first item to come out is the baguette served with sea salt butter. It was still warm when it came out, and absolutely delicious. The next is the salad, which has a delicious vinaigrette on it. Then the generous serving of steak comes out, which is cooked to absolute perfection. It comes served with bearnaise sauce on the side, which has peppercorns and tarragon. French fries are offered from serving bowl with unlimited refills! The next surprise was the dessert cart, which offered a wide selection of fantastic desserts. The Paris-brest was the best I have ever had, and the pannacotta was light and delicious! This is a very fairly priced meal and absolutely delicious. I will be returning soon!",
