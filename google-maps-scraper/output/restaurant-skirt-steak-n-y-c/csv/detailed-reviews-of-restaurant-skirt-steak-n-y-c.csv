My daughter has been wanting to go here for some time after seeing it on TikTok. She s a steak lover and I love French fries so this place combined the best of both worlds. Skirt Steak had gone viral for its prix fixe menu where you order your 6oz skirt steak to your liking; well, medium well, medium or rare. This is accompanied by a salad with a little olive based dressing, and unlimited fries for $45. Other than fries, they do offer other sides which are limited: Scalloped potatoes with cheese & bacon and broccoli. Their sides are $12 additional and are ever changing, so expect something different if you go. They also offer an assortment of desserts for $12 as well. The beverage menu was a little limited that started at about $6. Overall the ambiance of the restaurant was quaint and intimate. If you go, expect a line at the door and the waiting time may average about 15 to 20 minutes depending on the size of your party. I was satisfied and I enjoyed my experience. My daughter and I order our skirt steaks medium which was served with a bearnaise sauce. In addition to the salad and unlimited French fries we order the potatoes smothered with cheese & bacon. I ordered a regular margarita which was pretty strong and my daughter ordered a Diet Coke. We also ordered dessert. I ordered a chocolate cake with icing and my daughter ordered the bloody orange tart. My chocolate cake was underwhelming but my daughter s dessert tasted like fruit loops  I really liked the tart. I didn t know what to expect since my daughter picked it but we both enjoyed our dinner experience at Skirt Steak. This is the place for you if you love red meat  there are NO other protein options. It s a pretty straightforward and to the point menu without the frills. I highly recommend getting your steak prepared medium as it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely return.

We were immediately brought a drink and a nice plate of salad while the host showed us the restaurants fixed dish, and yes! Because the local formula is: 1. A plate of salad served immediately 2. A cut of beef cooked to your needs. 3. All you can it chips. The meat was very soft, the salad non-trivial and the chips crunchy (but I add a little too salty). Optimal. The bill was fair for how we were treated and for what we ate (about 100 dollars for two), but considering that very famous places in NY charge you 30 dollars for a toast  we can say that it is a fair price.

Una volta dentro ho apprezzato lo stile del locale e lordine nellarredamento (sembra un locale superiore). Ci e stata portato subito da bere e una bel piatto di insalata mentre il camere ci illustrava il piatto fisso del locale, e si! Perche la formula de locale e: 1. Un piatto di insalata servito subito 2. Una tagliata di manzo cotta secondo le proprie esigenze. 3. Patatine all you can it. La carne era morbidissima, linsalata non banale e le patatine croccanti (ma aggiungo un po troppo salate). Ottimo.

The skirt steak was tender and juicy, cooked to a perfect medium rare as I requested. The bearnaise sauce added a rich and creamy touch, while the field greens balanced out the heaviness of the meat. The fries were crispy and hot, and I loved that they kept refilling them without me having to ask. The service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was lively and warm.Skirt Steak is a great place to enjoy a simple but satisfying meal at a reasonable price.

At Skirt Steak it literally just one main on the menu, in this case skirt steak, unlimited fries, bread basket, and salad, for $39. It is beautiful. After a long day and you dont want to make a bunch more decisions, its super refreshing. How do you want it cooked, what do you want to drink, thats it. Theres also a handle full of rotating sides as well as garlic bread you can add on, though the main event is usually more than enough. The atmosphere is also great and calming, nicely lit and all unstained wood. Feels causal, elegant, and fun, with almost a high end pop up vibe. They dont take reservations, which in this case is a big benefit, as I know I can always go last minute when I have a craving for steak or forgot to make a reservation for something else. May take a little while, youll often see a long line at busy times, but it tends to move pretty quick. Likely as everyone there sits down and simply says...

For what it cost and the 45 minute wait I feel there are better places in the city to get a steak and fries. We also got the ratatouille which was a great addition because it helped with the very over powering charcoal flavor from the steak. I got the rare and medium steak both had a strong charcoal flavor. The fries were warm and the salad was random sizes of chopped lettuce with vinegar. The service was really great and super attentive but the food just simple wasn t worth going back for. Maybe if you really cover all the steak in the small side of sauce does it take away some of the charcoal but even then there s easily better places to eat.

ChIJZzeRDkBZwokRODxBJ-bYauA,Skirt Steak,932674b7cc095ff10bd49e3979d91cff,3,"Summary: good concept almost carbon-copied from French restaurant chain Relais de LEntrecote- and notably misses the mark on key elements. The Good: Overall, the restaurant decor, service, and food were top tier. Our server was Larissa, and we felt very much that we were well waited on throughout the night! For a Thursday night, we waited ~20 minutes, which I thought was perfect for a bustling restaurant. The ambience felt very warm and welcoming, and I loved the wooden columns and decor. The dessert selection was also excellent and very much on par with other NYC restaurants. The Not Good: Frankly, Im only giving this restaurant 3 stars because, as a concept, Relais de LEntrecote does it better. Charging $2 for extra Bearnaise felt very slimy, and felt like the restaurant was being stingy rather than willing to get people to try their linchpin ingredient that ties the steak and fries together. Relais also serves 2 portions of steak initially, then follows up with another portion of steak - meanwhile, Skirt Steak only serves the initial two portions (perfectly cooked, I recommend rare here), then does not allow for further portions. That second portion makes all the difference at the other restaurant, as it helps keep you satisfied in your appetite- here, I wanted more, but all I had were fries with no sauce and no meat :(. Other minor points are to add salt and pepper to the table - I actually wanted the salt for the fries, not the meat, but it felt trite to have to ask for these condiments at a steak restaurant of all places, where there will be a vast range of steak preferences from different patrons. Generally speaking, I really liked this place, and wanted it to succeed- it is succeeding too! I just know that other places with a very similar premise have features that make the dining experience there that much more satisfying.

My husband, a friend and I went to this place on Aug 12. We all had been wanting  to try this place for a while and that day was the day. So, a long line outside should be a good indicator, but once we were seated, the waiter gave us only the drunk list and start telling us in speed of a roadrunner of all items on the menu, not offering any other menu, not trying to tell us to look at the board above our table. Was he expecting us to remember the 1st item he mentioned when he finished his 15th items? Hellll no. He tried to upsell and maybe trying to use the confusion strategy to get peoplenot, mostly are tourists, to nod...get $$$$. Most importantly, if he had to talk that much trying to upset his items, he should have worn a mask. I know its not mandatory anymore for COVID. But there are other things beside COVID that come with the saliva. ....thats to me was the 1st red flag. So, we ended up getting their basic set. It started with the salad. A generous amount of salad which was unedible. We all had a bit or two and we put our fork down. It didnt look fresh. My husband and our friend said it was bitter. I said the veggies look old and the salad dressing is horrible. When the meat came with fries, the meat portion was smaller than what we expected, not like Les Venise steak house on Lexington. The fries was oily. So, we just finished the meat, paid and leave. Beside food, my husband ordered a coke, they brought Diet Coke. I normally would order an alcoholic drink and dessert when dinning out, but not this time. I dont feel like giving more money to support the poor services.

When the bill came out- my partner and I gave a low tip because of it and then they charged 20 more dollars to our bill. Also steak is way overpriced. A standard steak place will charge you about 20 bucks for a 6 oz and 2 well made sides. This placed charged us 33 for a six ounce and fries that looked like they were taken from mcdolnalds. Steak definitely didn t deserve the 33 dollar charge and staff needs more training on listening to their customers. Very unhappy!!!,a year ago,2023-03-02 11:31:00.978211,,,,1,3,,False,,

I ve seen it hyped up on social media and have been wanting to try it. The service was great. The salad had something extremely bitter in it that me and my partner couldn t even finish it. I ordered the steak medium and it was crazy chewy. Then the desserts came around in a cart and looked beautiful. The key lime pie was great as for the flan it has some sort of a butterscotch topping which made it almost made it inedible  because it was wild sweet. I m not sure why someone would add that to a flan since it s already super sweet. As for drinks I had the spritzer and that was great.

The salad would have been good, but the salad dressing felt grainy for some reason? It also needs to be said that it felt like there was a very large charge for everything. No drinks were free, including water - 12 dollars for a liter bottle. A side of tator tots was 10 dollars.

We didnt have to wait but it was pretty packed at that time already. For drinks, I had the blackberry spritz, which wasnt bad. Fruity but not too sweet. The skirt steak ($28) comes with a side of au poivre (probably?) sauce, a salad, and unlimited fries. There are only three doneness options: well done, medium well, or rare. I usually get medium rare so I opted for the rare, which pretty much was like medium rare. The steak was pretty salty and chewy. It was kind of disappointing. The fries looked soggy but they actually taste better than it looks. The best part of the meal was probably the salad. Its a butter lettuce salad, though they were a bit heavy handed on the dressing.

They dont let you go empty on the fries(in a nice way.) Staff is quick to grab empty plates and very friendly.

ChIJZzeRDkBZwokRODxBJ-bYauA,Skirt Steak,f8cf195d2ea041aa2eb05830ee78a8c2,2,"I was very excited to dine here. The reviews seemed great. First off, there is NO two hour wait. On Saturday and Sunday the restaurant opens for brunch (same menu, with the addition of garlic bread for $12, and no option for bottomless drinks). The hours on those days are 11:30a-3p and the reopen at 5pm until closing (10/11p). Therefore, people made it during 3-5p and decided themselves to wait. Moving on. This was my second time here because of that. Our table had bread crumbs on it and the paper placemats had an oil stain. The waitress dusted it off but we had to ask the bus boy to replace the paper. Underneath had more crumbs and dirt and he threw the new mat over it. Unacceptable. Next, we were told buy a manager there was no Prosecco but the waitress said there was. When it was brought to the table it was flatter than fast food soda. Unacceptable. The server really tries to upcharge by selling you on $10 sides. But the food comes with 2 sides- my personal opinion is just to offer substitutions or $1 upcharge to switch it because you still get the salad + fries + extra side(s). My biggest issue was that this restaurant use PEANUT OIL to fry their fries AND you dont know until you ask. In a world full of allergies this should be readily disclosed. Unacceptable. *Disclamer- all the desserts, with the exception of the Chocolate cake, are made with NUTS* The meat is served Med Rare, Medium, and Well Done. What also went wrong was that 4 orders of meat came out severely undercooked when we asked for Medium. At this point I was turned off and no longer hungry. Our waitress started off very friendly but soon didnt show up to our table at all. The manager Savaah stopped by the table was was extremely personable. He spoke with us a little and apologized for the experience and welcomed us to dine their again in hopes we would change our minds. Because of his visit to the table and his generous offers we reconsidered. However, after reviewing it with my party we probably will not, not based on the experience but based on the food quality itself. The portion size for one is a 4-6 oz steak, a licorice flavored salad, and cold + burnt fries. Savaah has increased my star review, and I sincerely thank you, but ultimately I would not recommend this restaurant. Pictures to follow.",a year ago,2023-03-02 11:31:16.381435,,,,2,117,87,True,,

Rare, medium and well are the only options.  We ordered 4 mediums and 1 rare, what we received was a hodge-podge of raw to medium-well, sometimes within one portion.  The waiter kindly offered to take some of the raw pieces back.  That sauce was tasty, and necessary to season the otherwise bland skirt steak. 2. The unlimited fries - so disappointing.  Overcooked and cold.  After the second refill of dry cold fries, we asked for a new batch, and the waiter finally brought us some hot fries. 3.  Dessert- key lime pie, with an unnecessary but,very dramatic looking, fluff tasting meringue was okay.  Thin slice of desserts not worth the $10 go to a local bakery instead. 4. Sides - never received the sides we ordered to yeah that happened. 5. Drinks - again save your money.  The non-alcoholic Cranberry Rosemary drink is simple syrup and seltzer with a tablespoon of cranberry juice. Another $10 wasted. 6.  Overall atmosphere- People literally kept their coats on because it was so cold.  Either this was done on purpose or a malfunctioning hvac system, either was it was horribly cold and drafty.

They had also asked if we would like a refill on fries but they never came back to provide the fries. Finally servers/busboys came back shortly after and started to take our food again taking only a half eaten spinach side, this time without asking at all.

The service is amazing, staff are fun, and the decor is homely and cute - the vibes are impeccable! Now for the food - I want to say that for the price of $28, the fixed meal does seem like a good deal. However, to start, they already give you a large portion of fries. Chances of you getting seconds for the bottomless fry deal are low, and if you did, youd probably say something like oh, just a little bit please. The steak itself is quite a small portion. In my pictures, unfortunately I was too hungry and forgot to take it before I started eating... but as you see on the hot plate, there are two spots of meat. Those were (before we began eating) two separate portions. Make of that what you will. Sides and dessert are extra charge, which is expected. For $28, the meal will definitely fill you up, just not necessarily on the steak. I love the sauce they serve with the steak, and the steak itself is cooked beautifully. I do want to mention though that as a whole, the meal was extremely salty for me. The seasonings are heavy - be it the salad, fries, or steak. The sides that we ordered, such as the Spinach gratin and potato/bacon side were also extremely salty. The only break I had was taking enormous gulps of water. The dessert on the other hand was wonderful.  Not too sweet, but still rich enough to make me feel like I was indulging in a dessert. I ordered the citrus cheesecake. I want to say that this place is worth the experience. The food is good and so is the atmosphere. Staff are so so friendly. However, if youre looking for a larger quantity of steak and perhaps just less of a sodium blast in general, you might as well buy a nice cut of ribeye or whatever you prefer, cook it up at home, and season to your liking. To me, it isnt worth waiting out in the cold for several hours like other reviews had mentioned. I arrived on a Thursday 20 minutes before opening and was seated promptly.

It s definitely worth it, $28 u get a beautiful classic green salad w/ mixed herbs and vinaigrette, the skirt steak is served on a cast iron skillet with some kind of brown sauce (does not taste like peppercorn sauce), temp of the steak was well executed, juicy and a little bit of a biTe since it s skirt steak, the char from the grill was exactly what I was looking for, they served the unlimited fries from a big bowl, the server was walking around the dining room offering fries refill.

ChIJZzeRDkBZwokRODxBJ-bYauA,Skirt Steak,77bfb7913bbace3386b8e3add9b8b737,2,"Came into Skirt Steak on a Wednesday night. Party of four and we waited around a half an hour. The hostess was nice and got us seated relatively quickly. When we sat, we were greeted by our waiter. It was explained to us that there are three ways to cook the steak, either rare, medium, or well done - and that the meal comes with unlimited fries and salad to start. He brought us some still water and asked us if wed like bread to start - he said yes. When we were brought the bread, there were 6 pieces for 4 people. Not to mention the fact that nobody ever mentioned wed be charged $10 for BREAD. I thought this was an extremely predatory sales tactic, but whatever. Then, the salads came. Everybody at the table had salad that was way too bitter to eat. At first, we thought it was the dressing, but after asking for another salad with the dressing on the side, we noticed the lettuce was inedible - it was too bitter to eat. Upon further inspection, we noticed that the lettuce had to have been spoiled. As a waiter of 3 years myself, I have never heard one account of lettuce being spoiled or bitter  Then, we asked for an order of bread for the table and again were given not even enough for 4 people to eat two slices of bread. When we asked for more, we were told wed be charged, even though we were charged the $10 for the bread initially AND we didnt eat any salad. Not to mention the fact that they dont have any salad dressing OTHER than ONE SINGLE vinaigrette, or the fact that the only real dipping sauce they have for their unlimited fries is ketchup, mayo, and siracha. Almost $40 a person without the dessert and I cant eat my fries with BBQ sauce or my salad with caesar dressing. Next, the meat was brought. The only highlight of the meal and the only reason Im giving this experience a two star. I was very upset because I asked for my meat medium, and more on the pink side if possible, and the waiter just nodded his head and never made sure my meat was pink. The unlimited fries that came with my meal became cold within seconds - indicating that fries were not fresh. On top of everything, during sitting for a 2-hour meal, our fries were replenished twice. The meat was OKAY. Nothing to write home about, but at least I got something filling that I could eat throughout all of this. On top of everything, our waiter checked on us once after getting our orders - thats it. We were served primarily by the busboys. I wish I could say this was the end of my experience, but it wasnt. We asked to split the bill four ways and the waiter told me that the machine doesnt do this. I dont understand how thats possible? As someone who has operated an OS responsible for a restaurant, and as someone who has easily split checks 3 ways - I knew this was a lie. The waiter did not attempt to be helpful at all, and instead insisted we only give him 2 cards. I understand that running a restaurant costs money, but when youre paying $5 for a slim glass of Coca-Cola that PERHAPS houses a half a can, or when youre charging $10 for bread [unheard of], at least make sure your computers [in 2022] are capable of paying checks. The funniest part to me is that the waiter came up to the table with his hands behind his back, asked us if we were ready for the check, and when we said yes, he pulled the check out and handed it to us - absolutely rushing to get us out of the restaurant to flip the table. Lets recount my experience: -30 minute wait, inedible salad, predatory sales tactics [selling bread for $10?], no real help from my waiter, meat not cooked to my liking, the only time the waiter showed us any real attention was to get his tip, no sauces, no dressings other than ONE shallot vinagrette At least the fries were good though, right?

The $28 meal is a fair buy for whats included, you will definitely not leave feeling hungry with the unlimited fries/$10 appetizers offered. The dessert cart is just the cherry on top, I had the French pastry and chocolate cake. I would go for the French pastry as the chocolate cake wasn t too special. What I loved the most was everything tasted fresh. The meat was absolutely delicious, and the unlimited fries were always served HOT. One thing, I would not recommend is the American wagu. Very fatty delicious but it does not top the steak served with the $28 meal. Give it a try, it s a nice vibe for date night.

Also, for a steak house I was surprised by the beer selection, it was not generic and was quite nice. However, the good for me ends there ... First, the steak... It was alight but in my opinion just lacked flavor even with the bechamel sauce they provided I felt myself wanting more. I probably would have covered it in A1 if they offered it, that is how little flavor it had. As for the fries they were ok but were nothing to write home about. The extra sides they had ranged from $10-$12 but have to admit they were quite small, we got Brussel Sprouts, Spinach and Cauliflower Gratin.

ChIJZzeRDkBZwokRODxBJ-bYauA,Skirt Steak,855a8d9aa54a94102aae6123b029a1ad,5,"Unlimited fries. Now I have your attention, Skirt Steak offers a high-quality dinner at an affordable price. The entree selection is reduced to one item and the dining experience is friendly and efficient. This isnt the Gallaghers or Keens steakhouse treatment, but youll leave Skirt Steak content and happy. Detailed review below: Skirt Steak first presented me an interior gabled with a barn like framing bathed in warm light. Inviting and friendly are both the aesthetic and the staff. When walking to my table there was an energy in the air as other diners ate, conversed, and enjoyed their meal. Great ambiance. The table was adorned with neatly folded napkins nestling card stock menus. Utensils and cups befittingly positioned. The surface was covered in a paper place setting with the words: Greens, Skirt Steak, Fries / $28 stamped on the corners. This simple mantra is the basis of simple elegance. I glanced once again around the room and appreciated the rustic design. Even the speakers were made of light-colored wood to match the framing. Their menu is clean and easy to read with a spartan grouping of wines, beer, cocktails, and dessert. The wine and beer arrays are diverse enough to satisfy most palates while the cocktail selection offers riffs on a few classics. The titular Skirt Steak is offered in only three temperatures: rare, medium, and well. I ordered a Skirt Manhattan and a rare steak with spinach. Bread arrived before the meal with soft spreadable butter. The bread had a firm crust with a soft interior while the butter was rich and salted. The Skirt Manhattan was textbook; spirit forward with just enough vermouth to cut the harshness of the whiskey. The default green of the meal was a small salad of raw leafy veggies with herbs and a marinade. It tasted of fennel and dill drizzled with olive oil and a dash of lemon. I must say the salad is underrated. It brought a freshness to the experience and prepared me for the heavier main course. The steak was crusted on the exterior and served sliced on a griddle exposing the pink center. Fries were thin, crispy, and well salted. On its own, the steak was properly seasoned and the combination of the textures was lovely. There was a sauce which appeared to be bearnaise served on the side. I can only describe the sauce as culinary napalm as it was so viscous it could stick to anything and make it fire. Spinach was tender and flavorful. Unlimited fries sounds amazing but in the big picture the meal is so complete the unlimited fries are more of a novelty than a necessity. The star of the dinner was the dessert. I did not expect to be blown away as I do not have a sweet tooth but when the dessert cart rolled to the table, I knew I was in for a treat. The elaborate glass and wood chest matched the rustic aesthetic of the restaurant and emitted an aura as if it was the arc of the covenant. My table ordered a few pastries. The flan is the best Ive ever had, I still yearn for the chocolate tart with berries, and the paris-brest was delicate and decadent. My only complaint with both the desert and the restaurant is that they did not serve coffee. Seems like an unfortunate oversight as coffee would have enhanced the wonderful dessert. Overall skirt steak delivers a high-quality meal at an affordable price with excellent service in a relaxed yet stylish atmosphere.

If however they started doing reservations, bettered their steak cooking, and reworked the alcohol menu to be based at least vaguely in reality, it could be a great occasional place to bring an out of town friend.",2 years ago,2022-03-02 11:31:31.773127,,,,0,70,19,True,,

I present to you @skirtsteak.nyc, the eponymously named restaurant known for serving only Skirt steak. There is only 1 thing on their menu which is conveniently printed on the left hand corner of table. $28 for the full course menu. Consisting of a field green salad, skirt steak and endless handmade fries. Upon being seated the waiter took our drink order and gave us a basket of bread, which was great. It had a crunchy crust with fluffy soft inside that paired great with butter. It was simply great bread. The field green salad is adequate, its a salad. The greens are fresh and earthy/herby in flavor, I cant remember if there was dressing but then again this is a salad at a steak restaurant its not suppose to be memorable. I managed to finish it, my brother did not. The skirt steak, the star of the show, arrived shortly after we were done with our salads. And cooked perfectly to the temperature requested (medium rare). The outside had a nice sear and the overall steak was extremely flavorful and tender. I didnt know skirt steak would be done this well. It is also served with like a garlic butter sauce, I tried a piece with the sauce but honestly it wasnt needed. The steak is great on it own. Instead use that sauce for the endless fries. The endless fries are served alongside the steak and yes its truly endless, as soon as you empty the bowl they bring a refill, until you ask them to stop. And the fries are also top-notch; crispy and fresh. So good that we had 3 refills. The menu also has a changng number of  daily sides ($9) that waiter will introduce. We went with the cauliflower gratin which was just a cheesy cauliflower delight! And last and certainly not least they have an amazing dessert cart that gets pushed out after you finish and do yourself a favor, order dessert. I had this amazing hazelnut flavor dream of a dessert and I forget what my brother ordered. I wish I could remember the name of it but instead I used that limited space in my memory to just remember that taste of that dessert.

My waitress offered garlic bread and worded it in such a way that my friends and I thought it was free, when in fact its $9 per loaf (a short baguette like bread that was filled with some garlic-buttery pesto). The steak was great as expected but the fries were nothing spectacular of McDonalds fries. The server of the fries (some guy who walks around with a bowl of fries and tongs) spilled fries in my glass of water, and I was never offered a new cup. Desert was served a la carte and too was vastly overpriced as each item is either $9-$10, of course there was no mention from the servers of the price as they expect you to remember them from the little menu-pamphlet I was given 45 minutes ago. I decided to get the carrot cake and it tasted like your average store bought slice. All in all I feel that the $47 (tax+tip included) I spent for the prixe fixe and the garlic bread + cake I split with my friends was not worth the experience.",2 years ago,2022-03-02 11:31:32.580339,,,,3,27,12,True,,

The service, drinks and food were good and its tough to beat a decent steak that comes with salad and unlimited fries for $28. Decided to stop by again for a low-key dinner on my birthday and man this place has changed.  All of the decently separated tables are reserved for influencers and friends of the owner and large groups.  I would completely understand that if those tables were full to begin with.  That was not the case at all last night. Our dinner lasted about an hour and a half and the influencer tables were only half booked the entire time we were there so we were pretty annoyed that we were denied a decent empty table. This place clearly has not been able to handle the hype its gotten over social media. The host staff seemed wildly unprepared to organize a walk-in only restaurant.

The skirt steak is served with a really great sauce as well as unlimited French fries (they ll come around and ask you if you want more!)

When I asked if I could just sit at the bar, they hedged back and forth and finally said yes. I learned this would soon be a consistent approach as I was sat by the door, overhearing others come in. Each person coming in was given wildly different answers as they came in. The red-headed bartender (never shared her name) was initially alone behind the bar, so we cut her some slack. However absolute disinterest was the only thing she served us without an exorbitant wait. Were talking 20+ minutes for a requested water refill. We ordered our food after sitting there more than 30 minutes, and bread and salad came pretty quickly. Standard, boring, Golden Corral level of fare. It then took over 45 minutes after the salads to get out steaks. I finally asked the bartender because two people that had come in an hour after us got their food first. She went to the kitchen, and clearly our steaks had been given to others at the bar. The steak itself was cooked well temperature wise for medium. It was crusted with so much salt, I assume to try and tenderize it, that it was nearly inedible. The fries were hit or miss, with half of them being oily and soggy.

In addition to the steak, fries, and salad, we added on the garlic bread ($9) and two desserts (key lime pie and chocolate mouse for $9 each) and would recommend all three. Blackberry spritz was good but they were out of the spices for the spiced margarita so I ordered a regular margarita which I would not recommend. We arrived at around 4:30pm (on a Friday) and there was no line so we took a walk around the block. When we came back at around 4:45, a line had started to form and it grew quickly. We were seated around 5:15 or so which wasn t bad at all but I can t imagine being at the end of that line as it obviously moved slower once the tables filled up. So definitely go early if you want to avoid a long wait as the line was even longer when we left. (They don t take reservations for parties under seven people). While we enjoyed the food, they would need to sort out some of the service issues before we return. Our server was nice (no complaints there) but we had to wait close to 30+ minutes for them to refill the fries at our table and by the time they had brought the second round of fries, my steak was then cold. A bit frustrating as they mentioned that the fries were unlimited several times while seating us etc. As a new restaurant, it is understandable that they are working out some of the kinks in the service but I would have appreciated some communication that there was a delay in the kitchen instead of just avoiding our table like they did.",2 years ago,2022-03-02 11:31:38.136140,,,,7,13,11,True,,

Beautiful atmosphere and everything was delicious from the salad (on a chilled plate!) to the desert. Very pleasant, and attentive wait staff too.

Ive never been to a restaurant that only has one main item on the menu but its steak so we went for it. For $28 each person gets a salad, skirt steak, and unlimited fries. Delicious. But the real icing on the cake, if you will, was the dessert cart pushing along to every table that got cleared. Like a fairy godmother popping in for your last wish. Anyways, we got 4 different desserts and each one was magnificent. Great food, great service. We will definitely be back.",2 years ago,2022-03-02 11:31:39.225782,,,,6,75,232,True,,

Gotta love all these single option restaurants that do one thing REALLY well.

The steak was nicely charred on the outside yet remained perfectly tender. We were convinced to order the Paris-Brest for dessert and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. My only complaint is that they tried pushing drinks on us too much, but otherwise the service was top notch.",2 years ago,2022-03-02 11:31:40.222027,,,,2,15,9,False,,
ChIJZzeRDkBZwokRODxBJ-bYauA,Skirt Steak,7635f3c82b81405f4c371b3c726010a4,5,"Skirt Steak is unbelievably good. Unlimited hand cut, house made french fries, perfectly crisped and golden brown. Service is extremely quick and all the staff is extremely friendly. The atmosphere is very inviting and the entire restaurant feels very open and pleasant. The beer list is quite varied and feels curated quite well to pair with the meal. The first item to come out is the baguette served with sea salt butter. It was still warm when it came out, and absolutely delicious. The next is the salad, which has a delicious vinaigrette on it. Then the generous serving of steak comes out, which is cooked to absolute perfection. It comes served with bearnaise sauce on the side, which has peppercorns and tarragon. French fries are offered from serving bowl with unlimited refills! The next surprise was the dessert cart, which offered a wide selection of fantastic desserts. The Paris-brest was the best I have ever had, and the pannacotta was light and delicious! This is a very fairly priced meal and absolutely delicious.
