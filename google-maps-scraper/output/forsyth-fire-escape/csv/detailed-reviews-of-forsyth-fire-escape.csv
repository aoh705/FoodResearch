I was so excited to try this burrito as I ve been following them since they actually served from their fire escape. I got there 2 hours after opening and they were already out of the pernil, so I got the chicken as a consolation. They said it would be 10 minutes but it took 30. After waiting a half hour I received a small burrito filled with dry chicken and a minuscule amount of guacamole and cheese. Completely devoid of love and way overpriced for the amount of food.

Location and maybe price may have a bit to do with that.  It was $14, but that isnt much more than a burrito from Dos Toros these days. They try to upsell you on the sauces to get sides of them, but no thanks, since it says it comes with the sauce already in the description. I got it and took it to eat on the way out. Overall, Id agree with others that is a bit too salty.  The lemongrass sauce definitely was in there, but just in one little pocket.  It was tasty. They probably should just put more on there for the price you pay.
