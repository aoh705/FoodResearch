The calamari was hot and fresh, and there was no filler! The martini was strong and had perfect proportions (in my opinion), and my coworker loved his drink. We had the short rib and the the steak, both cooked so well and full of flavor. Ended with two espresso martinis, well-balanced and a great way to end the night! Our server was kind and attentive, we will definitely be returning as we work nearby.",

No big deal. We were seated about 10 min later. Food came out. We were barely finished eating when the hostess came over to infrom us that we had at most 10 minutes because they had a 7:30 reservation, but could be seated at the bar. So, we had around 50 min. to eat. We were going to order another round of cocktails and dessert. We said something to our waiter and he was even surprised. Before leaving I mentioned something to hostess about sitting at the bar and she was very indifferent and mentioned if we could find a seat go ahead. Of course none available. I said we have  never had an hour limit on dinner before and the other tables beside us were clearly there well before us and still there. I think it was then she realized we had not even been there an hour. But offered no solution.  We would have definitely been back before that, but after being asked to leave for the next reservation, we will not. Disappointing because the waiter was excellent and food was good.",

We did not but she accommodated us and asked the we simply be done by 8:30 because she had someone who reserved our table at that time, otherwise the wait would have been 30-45 minutes. We sat down and the serve greeted us quickly and was very pleasant.  She took our drink order and app order and returned quickly with the beverages.  While she didnt make any recommendations, she did comment on all of our food choices saying that one in particular was her favorite.  The server checked in on us frequently and never left us waiting for her. The food was delicious!  The wings where perfectly spiced, the cheese steak spring roles came out hot and dripping with cheese.  Everyone at the table was very happy with their main courses (pasta, chicken, and salad). All in all a great experience!",

The beer was good. Service was truly bad. It was EXTREMELY hard to order a drink, harder still to order the food. A second drink eventually got ordered with the help of a random waitress that was dropping off some plates and noticed I was sitting with an empty glass and being ignored. Its possible that the bartenders see that I was alone and decided that I should be ignored strategically to maximize their tips? I like to think not, but I guess its possible. Definitely incorrect reasoning from them if that was the case, but I cant understand what else would explain it. (A couple sitting next to me had also been ignored though, and they were finding it quite funny) After drink 2 I gave up and spent the rest of my evening at another bar directly across the road where ordering wasnt a battle. Really annoyingly the food that I ordered was EXCELLENT and is the only reason this is 3 stars and not 1. I certainly wont ever go back under any circumstances, but its a shame",

Arrived early, and they were very accommodating, and sat us almost immediately. Waiter was great, well spaced everything, and then even gave us time to consider dessert. (Of course we split a slice of Limoncello cake and it was wonderful!) For dinner, we split the Cheese Steak Spring Rolls. They were delicious. For dinner we each had the Bacon wrapped Pork Loin. It was absolutely amazing. My husband and I are still raving about it, and it was over a week ago! On the way out, I realized I was developing a small blister (new shoes...dummy me) and the girls at the podium in the front of the restaurant were both so kind, and one got me a couple of bandaids. I havent been in this part of the city in so many years. I cant wait to schedule something at The Garden, so I have an excuse to come back. P.S. the Water Closets (bathrooms) were clean as well.",

My guest & I stumbled upon Juniper Bar because it was near our hotel (Henna Hotel) and we wanted an early 3:30pm dinner. I enjoyed the Fried Chicken Ban Mi (a Vietnamese-style sub) with perfectly cooked fries. And my guest had a slider. Our server was courteous & efficient. // As we were leaving around 4:30pm, some of the front tables were being rearranged or cleared - apparently for the happy hour crowd to arrive. Next time Im in town, Ill have to come for happy hour!",

The drinks menu was pretty varied and delicious. The bar itself is fun and casual with a locals only for the most part. Absolutely full before Rangers games so plan ahead. The dining area was VERY tightly squeezed in. There were a few more tables than there should be for people to be able to move freely, so I can imagine it being a problem for some. Its also very loud in there. The bar is super long, lots of TVs. Great for sports watching. Big negative - only one bathroom for the whole place. Not one per gender, just one single one. If there were more, then they were so well hidden that there may as well only be one, so if you think you have to go, get in line before you actually really need to go.",

We did partake in a martini, beer, margaritas, and our kids had Roy Rogers, though our waiter had no idea what that was, and we informed him that it was simply Coke and cherries. Unfortunately, Junipers happy hour menu does not include any food items, so we ordered our kiddos 2 orders of truffle fries at $11 a piece. They were very good and came with 2 dipping options. The fare is American in nature, and the ambiance is decent. They have awesome music with a bar area, hightop tables to the side of the bar, and full tables towards the back half of the establishment. Overall, a good choice for low key fare and a decent value on happy hour drinks.",

We got there and the kitchen was going to close in a few minutes but they took our order. We had the calamari, glazed salmon and Napa chicken sandwich. I dont even like fish but my boyfriend had me try a piece of his salmon and I really liked it.  The grilled chicken on my sandwich was not dry which is a problem I usually have with other restaurants. He didnt eat all the calamari. He felt it wasnt well done. The breading was a really light color and kept falling right off.  The waitress suggested an ivy martini  for us considering were not really drinkers and she was spot on. It was so good. The ambiance was nice. We were able to have an intimate time together talking over a meal even though its a bar. It wasnt loud at all. Were going back to try other items on the menu.",

Our office is by Hudson Yards and its very difficult to find reasonably-priced, classy venues for large group happy hours. Leading up to the event, we mainly worked with Alyssa from the Events team. She was incredibly friendly, professional, and responsive. We used the downstairs semi-private lounge space. During the event, our service team was great. Bibi and Brailey were kind to all our guests and very responsive, going around the room to ensure folks had food and drinks. Everyone felt very taken care of. Would highly recommend!",

Reservations were made for a party of 6, and when we arrived we were told that they could not find the reservation.  We asked the Hostess if we could speak to the manager because she wasnt about to seat our party, even though we showed her the confirmation.  She actually hesitated...then went off to get him... Im not sure if she did because he never came over to us.  The hostess returns and then states she can seat us but that the HAPPY HOUR is not included. Huh? We asked why. She just said its not included again.  We asked to speak to the manager once again, she left the podium and wasnt gone 2 mins if that, and then stated that we can order happy hour drinks from our table. The waiter was nice and everything else was okay. Just okay.  Decor, food, atmosphere, okay. Im a Customer Service Instructor and the Gentlemen in my party were either Managers or Coordinators in the customer service industry and deal with the public on a daily basis.  We feel the Manager should have come out to greet us.  One of three things happened, the Hostess didnt notify the Manager or the Manager didnt want to deal with us, orrrr the hostess caught an attitude and didnt feel like dealing with us after they made the mistake with the reservation. Will I be going back? Probably not. First impressions are key.",

Food came out at a good pace as well. The cocktails were boozy and excellent. The watermelon cosmo was refreshing and tasty. Also got the a martini which was equally as good. For apps we got the calamari. It was tender but the breading did not stay on very well. The sauce was a great addition though for flavor and the calamari was seasoned well. Said it was sweet and spicy but the spice was pretty absent. The surf and turf sliders were great. The shrimp on there was a great combo with the coleslaw and short rib. My fries were soggy though which was a bummer. The marscapone cake tasted like it was a typical frozen pre-made dessert. My friend later that night ended up not feeling well after her burger though which is really unfortunate. Probably wouldnt be back unless I was just getting drinks.",

It is a little tight around the tables when there is a crowd. Food was tasty and prepared quickly. Started with the Calamari, We had the Hanger Steak Wrap and Salmon burger. Cooked perfectly. Staff kept table clear of empty dishes, bottles, and glasses. Not a quiet place but a great vibe before heading to a concert. Highly recommend it. Prices are very good. You will enjoy it.

The open bar from 6 to 7 was a great way to start the evening, and the host was incredibly friendly and efficient. The food platters were a highlight of the night - everything we tried was absolutely delicious, but the fried shrimps were my personal favorite. The sliders were also a hit with our group. It was clear that the staff at Juniper Bar take great pride in their food and service, as everyone in our party had a wonderful time. In fact, 14 of us were visiting New York and we all agreed that it was one of the highlights of our trip. I highly recommend giving Juniper Bar a try if youre in town - you wont be disappointed",

Went for dinner with two 2 year olds, no high chairs and waiter looked at us as if we had 3 heads when we asked for booster seats. Also no changing tables in the bathroom. This would have been manageable, but the icing on the cake was we were given a time limit on our table. After eating, we ordered more drinks and were told we had 15 more minutes because our table was reserved. There were about 12 other open tables in the same section and no private party, so this didnt make sense. We were rushed to gulp down our drinks and leave, after spending over $250. We felt we were rushed to leave because of the kids, who were not being rowdy or disturbing anyone. Being so close to MSG, where childrens events take place, they should maybe reconsider their treatment of parents with kids. We will definitely not be back.",

There was a large and boisterous group and they were having a good time - I am happy for them! But the back room can get very loud and hard to hear. The food was very good. It isnt fine dining but that wasnt what we came for. We mostly had an assortment of appetizers, and they were all quite delicious. The cheesesteak spring rolls were a hit and make for good pregame nosh. All in all, Juniper is a fun spot, convenient to MSG. I will consider it again in the future when looking for places near Penn Stn and the garden.",

They gave us a little cordoned off section near the door so we could all gather together. We were also allowed to drop off some decorations that morning so they would be there later for us to set up. We ordered a platter of bruschetta and mini cheesesteak wraps. I only had the bruschetta and it was ok- nothing special. People said the cheesesteaks were ok as well. This place is long and extends far to the back. We were there around 6 pm on a Saturday and it wasnt too crowded. Theres ample bar seating, but its a narrow space so it may get a little jammed if its crowded.",

I was worried because I googled Juniper and didnt see any reviews mentioning vegan options. I agreed to go, however, because I didnt want to be an inconvenience to my coworkers. They have a veggie burger that mentions feta cheese. I asked if the cheese could be kept off and was told yes, then we sat down. The waitress came by and said that, actually, the cheese is baked into the patty and so it cant be removed. I appreciate that my waitress checked and then let me know the dish could not be modified. In the end, I was able to make things work. I ordered a hummus appetizer that I shared with my colleagues. Then, for my meal, I ate the Baby Kale Salad without the yogurt. If you are vegan, you wont have the best selection, but there are a couple of options. Its a bit pricey for what you get IMO. The salad was $14 and didnt even come with bread. The hummus appetizer was $13. All in all, Im giving 4 stars because it was a decent experience. Not somewhere Id choose to go on a regular basis, but it worked for the occasion.",

Great menu and great service that also serves up quality drink and wine that you cant find in those Irish pubs!  Bartenders Paige and Amina were attentive and refreshing; what you hope to find in a small town let me get to know you bar/restaurant establishment.  We had great sliders and truffle fries, yum! We were searching all day for some place that served up a good glass of wine - and  felt lucky to have stumbled across this place.this.  Everything after that was icing on the cake!",

The drinks are good, particularly the gin drinks which is why I go. If you get there for happy hour, the $6 infused gin is hard to beat (assuming its a good thing its infused with. Sometimes they do stuff that sucks, like rosemary and gin imho is awful.) YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE BAR AREA FOR HAPPY HOUR PRICING! If you get seated elsewhere, then you dont get happy hour prices. If you do Open Table and book a reservation then they will probably not seat you in the bar and you wont get happy hour. Beware! Not a lot of options for vegetarians, so I always get the fries which are good.",

Dont they know that some people have summer Fridays and need some drink specials?! Anyway, Juniper wasnt a bad experience. We wanted a small bite to eat before an early dinner, so we opted for the sliders and the Vietnamese-style wings to share. For the sliders, you can do can do any combination of three of the following: Mini Burgers (with american cheese & sauteed onions), Crispy BLT Chicken Sliders (pepper jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, boston lettuce, tomato, chipotle aioli), or Crab Cake (fresh crab meat, bibb lettuce, plum tomato, spicy remoulade sauce). We went with two chicken and one crab. They were okay - tasted like something you could get from Costco, so I dont think it was really worth the $15. The wings were not bad. They were made with hoisin sauce, but had a little too much sauce so it was pretty salty. If I come back, it would only be for drinks during happy hour.",

But it has good yelp reviews, so there we were. Inside, its really pretty with velvet wallpaper and old wood. No drinks for us this day but the food was pretty solid. For appetizer we shared the flatbread grilled with mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, arugula, and balsamic. Light and tasty - a good start to the meal. I had the three sliders - burger, crab cake, and shrimp. They asked me how Id like my burger slider cooked. Kind of an unexpected sophistication for a humble slider. And it came out as asked. The shrimp were plump and juicy and tasted real good in between the buns. And the buns were soft brioche and not stale as I feared. The crab cake was a bit disappointing since it wasnt really lump - but it didnt claim to be either. The sliders came with hand cut fries that were like Belgian frites.  Sis got the salmon - didnt try it but everyone said it was quite good. My parents shared the goddess salad. The server was more than happy to split it in the back for us - always a plus since some places are weird about that. The salad was very fresh with a variety of components. They opted to get it with grilled chicken. On the whole everyone enjoyed their meal. I think even more so because these food wasnt as salty as typical restaurants. These servers were pleasant but the dish clearing was a little aggressive, especially considering the place was only half full. Three entrees plus appetizer for lunch came out to around $70 + tip. High, but not terrible considering its Manhattan. Definitely a place worth checking out.",

                "review_text": "I had an engagement party on Sunday, February 12th. At the end of the night, we had our gift cards out on one of the tables as we were packing up to leave. We were unable to find out exactly what happened, I do believe one of the staff members took it based off of surveillance cameras though the picture was cut off. I wrote this review before but took it down because the manager, Alyssa Aiola, asked me to. At the moment I complied because I wanted to smooth things out with an on going investigation... which led to me finding out that one of their employees stole from us during our engagement party. Alyssa claimed my review was slanderous, but everything I have said and will continue to say about this bar and their staff are TRUE. The day after the event, I nervously waited for any news from the staff about the cameras and what happened to the cards. Alyssa said she would review it with the owner who was on his way in... a few hours later I called and Alyssa was gone and the owner was NEVER set to come in. The following day they finally reviewed the footage and told me there was no evidence of theft or them accidently being thrown out. The following day after that the owner called me and offered me a free lunch/dinner. He defended his manager for lying and taking her sweet time to work on this, and said they did everything they could. As the paying customer who is experiencing this disaster (after what should have been a beautiful occasion), they were not the least bit sympathetic to what MY FIANCE AND I are going through. I had to file a police report and have put my friends and family in a terribly awkward position so that we can continue the investigation. They did not even tell me if they would fire their employee who stole from me or at least question him. They dedicated a few hours on this only after my FIRST review. Its such a shame, it is a BEAUTIFUL place but the management is cold, and has made this situation even more stressful than need be. The owner offered to refund me but then changed his mind 3 TIMES because he didnt like my review and wanted me to take it down.",
