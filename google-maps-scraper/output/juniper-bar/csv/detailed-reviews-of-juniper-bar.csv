I said we have  never had an hour limit on dinner before and the other tables beside us were clearly there well before us and still there.

The food that I ordered was good. The beer was good. Service was truly bad. It was EXTREMELY hard to order a drink, harder still to order the food. A second drink eventually got ordered with the help of a random waitress that was dropping off some plates and noticed I was sitting with an empty glass and being ignored. Its possible that the bartenders see that I was alone and decided that I should be ignored strategically to maximize their tips? I like to think not, but I guess its possible. Definitely incorrect reasoning from them if that was the case, but I cant understand what else would explain it. (A couple sitting next to me had also been ignored though, and they were finding it quite funny) After drink 2 I gave up and spent the rest of my evening at another bar directly across the road where ordering wasnt a battle.

Hard to have a convo without yelling. Staff was friendly and attentive. Food came out at a good pace as well. The cocktails were boozy and excellent. The watermelon cosmo was refreshing and tasty. Also got the a martini which was equally as good. For apps we got the calamari. It was tender but the breading did not stay on very well. The sauce was a great addition though for flavor and the calamari was seasoned well. Said it was sweet and spicy but the spice was pretty absent. The surf and turf sliders were great. The shrimp on there was a great combo with the coleslaw and short rib. My fries were soggy though which was a bummer. The marscapone cake tasted like it was a typical frozen pre-made dessert. My friend later that night ended up not feeling well after her burger though which is really unfortunate.

We were going to go to Asura, which has a vegan menu, but Asura had a Closed sign on their window for some reason (this was on January 3rd). I was worried because I googled Juniper and didnt see any reviews mentioning vegan options. I agreed to go, however, because I didnt want to be an inconvenience to my coworkers. They have a veggie burger that mentions feta cheese. I asked if the cheese could be kept off and was told yes, then we sat down. The waitress came by and said that, actually, the cheese is baked into the patty and so it cant be removed. I appreciate that my waitress checked and then let me know the dish could not be modified. In the end, I was able to make things work. I ordered a hummus appetizer that I shared with my colleagues. Then, for my meal, I ate the Baby Kale Salad without the yogurt. If you are vegan, you wont have the best selection, but there are a couple of options. Its a bit pricey for what you get IMO. The salad was $14 and didnt even come with bread. The hummus appetizer was $13. All in all, Im giving 4 stars because it was a decent experience.

We wanted a small bite to eat before an early dinner, so we opted for the sliders and the Vietnamese-style wings to share. For the sliders, you can do can do any combination of three of the following: Mini Burgers (with american cheese & sauteed onions), Crispy BLT Chicken Sliders (pepper jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, boston lettuce, tomato, chipotle aioli), or Crab Cake (fresh crab meat, bibb lettuce, plum tomato, spicy remoulade sauce). We went with two chicken and one crab. They were okay - tasted like something you could get from Costco, so I dont think it was really worth the $15. The wings were not bad.

Didnt realize it was much more of a bar with seating in the back than a full restaurant with a bar. But it has good yelp reviews, so there we were. Inside, its really pretty with velvet wallpaper and old wood. No drinks for us this day but the food was pretty solid. For appetizer we shared the flatbread grilled with mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, arugula, and balsamic. Light and tasty - a good start to the meal. I had the three sliders - burger, crab cake, and shrimp. They asked me how Id like my burger slider cooked. Kind of an unexpected sophistication for a humble slider. And it came out as asked. The shrimp were plump and juicy and tasted real good in between the buns. And the buns were soft brioche and not stale as I feared. The crab cake was a bit disappointing since it wasnt really lump - but it didnt claim to be either. The sliders came with hand cut fries that were like Belgian frites.  Sis got the salmon - didnt try it but everyone said it was quite good. My parents shared the goddess salad. The server was more than happy to split it in the back for us - always a plus since some places are weird about that. The salad was very fresh with a variety of components. They opted to get it with grilled chicken. On the whole everyone enjoyed their meal. I think even more so because these food wasnt as salty as typical restaurants. These servers were pleasant but the dish clearing was a little aggressive, especially considering the place was only half full. Three entrees plus appetizer for lunch came out to around $70 + tip.

At the end of the night, we had our gift cards out on one of the tables as we were packing up to leave. We were unable to find out exactly what happened, I do believe one of the staff members took it based off of surveillance cameras though the picture was cut off. I wrote this review before but took it down because the manager, Alyssa Aiola, asked me to. At the moment I complied because I wanted to smooth things out with an on going investigation... which led to me finding out that one of their employees stole from us during our engagement party. Alyssa claimed my review was slanderous, but everything I have said and will continue to say about this bar and their staff are TRUE. The day after the event, I nervously waited for any news from the staff about the cameras and what happened to the cards. Alyssa said she would review it with the owner who was on his way in... a few hours later I called and Alyssa was gone and the owner was NEVER set to come in. The following day they finally reviewed the footage and told me there was no evidence of theft or them accidently being thrown out. The following day after that the owner called me and offered me a free lunch/dinner. He defended his manager for lying and taking her sweet time to work on this, and said they did everything they could. As the paying customer who is experiencing this disaster (after what should have been a beautiful occasion), they were not the least bit sympathetic to what MY FIANCE AND I are going through. I had to file a police report and have put my friends and family in a terribly awkward position so that we can continue the investigation. They did not even tell me if they would fire their employee who stole from me or at least question him. They dedicated a few hours on this only after my FIRST review. Its such a shame, it is a BEAUTIFUL place but the management is cold, and has made this situation even more stressful than need be. The owner offered to refund me but then changed his mind 3 TIMES because he didnt like my review and wanted me to take it down.",7 years ago,2017-03-02 11:09:51.608150,,,,1,8,2,False,,
