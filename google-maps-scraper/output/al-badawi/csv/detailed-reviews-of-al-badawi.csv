Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and there was a lot of space and it wasn t too busy, which is surprising because the food was phenomenal. Our waiter was really patient with us helping us select our dishes given we wanted to learn about their traditional Palestinian dishes they specialize in. He helped us choose some of the restaurants favorite appetizers and main dishes. The pita bread was warm and freshly done, even smoky after pulling it apart. The muhammarah was my favorite appetizer and the malfouf was great too. The Mansaf was delicious - the rice had soaked the flavor of the lamb stewed in a yogurt broth. The lamb was so tender and delicious. Portions were a great size. Family style do you can share dishes amongst each other. I can t wait to come back and try more traditional dishes!

ChIJL_1fstBbwokRVaeht7CPayA,al Badawi,9d22f82f865cb96a535ff1e41a99aeb2,4,"Last evening, I had the pleasure of dining at a local restaurant, a night made particularly memorable by the presence of special guests from Pakistan. Among them was Khawaja Asif, the esteemed ex-Foreign Minister, and his companions Syed Anwar Wasti, Rohail Dar, Rana Saeed, Malik Khuram, and Jan. The dinner was graciously hosted by Amir Razaq of Bronx, whose choice of venue added a delightful touch to our gathering. The culinary highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the mix grill. Each morsel was cooked to perfection, offering a symphony of flavors that danced on the palate. It was a dish that resonated well with our distinguished guests, encapsulating the essence of fine dining. A special mention must be made of the mint tea. It was not just a beverage but an experience in itself. The refreshing aroma and the subtle yet invigorating flavor provided a perfect counterpoint to the rich meal. As for the sweets, they were nothing short of awesome. Each bite was a blend of sweetness and texture, rounding off the meal beautifully. However, despite the excellent food and company, there was one aspect that detracted from our experience - the noise level. The restaurants ambiance was marred by a cacophony that made it challenging to engage in meaningful conversation. It was a significant inconvenience, especially given the stature of our guests and the importance of dialogue in such gatherings. In light of this, I find myself compelled to give the restaurant a 3-star rating. While the culinary experience was exceptional, the noisy environment was a considerable drawback. Its a reminder that great food needs to be complemented by a conducive atmosphere, especially when hosting guests of such prominence.",2 months ago,2024-01-04 12:19:02.207113,,,,1,10,40,True,,

The flatbread was really good but at the end of the day its basically a white pizza with meat on it so although delicious, I wouldnt really seek it out. The pita bread / labneh / side hummus and side baba ganoush were outstanding as were the lamb chops. They serve you 5 lamb chops with rice, hummus, baba, chopped cucumbers and tomatoes, all for $34 (they informed me that it used to cost $28 for the same dish on their menu, before the inflation spike hit the economy). I highly recommend this place, even if it does have a few quirks (no soda/tea/coffee menu provided at all, you just have to ask the waiter for whatever drink you may want  and some of the tables are not flat, the wood curves up at the sides, unclear why, seems like it would make dining difficult (?)).

The food is top-notch, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is perfect for a casual lunch or a night out with friends. I came here with a group of four and we were incredibly stuffed (in the best way) with the dishes we ordered. We ordered the mezze filistini ($27) which was a mixed platter of hummus, baba ghanoush, muhammara, tabbouleh, salata tahuna & labneh (paired with some delicious flatbread that came straight out of their oven), the shrimp flatbread ($21), and the fattat jaj ($28) The fattat jaj was SO GOOD and probably one of my favorite dishes. I wish I had more stomach space to finish up the rest but we were so full by the time it came that I was honestly surprised that I still thought it was good - probably means it would have been EVEN better had we gotten it earlier on in the meal. The server gave us the pistachio flatbread instead of the shrimp flatbread and she was so nice to say that we could keep both!

Never asked us if we wanted drinks. We ordered the mezza, mussakhan and lamb ouzi. The mezza was superb. The mussakhan had at least 3-4 onions. It was very good but way too much onions and sumac. It was all I tasted. Her ouzi wasn t palatable. I know cinnamon is used but it was used so heavy handed here that we couldn t eat it. The only thing that saved this was the lamb was tender and spiced right. If you re going to represent our beautiful Palestinian food, please do so with care and honor.

Well prepared, generous portions, tasty and made to order are big pluses. As a solo diner could not order a main course because they are big enough to share, so had to limit my choices to appetizers, the best of all three being the kibbeh, which was light and fluffy and fried to perfection. The cauliflower on the zahir was burnt in places and that added an unwanted bitterness to the mix, that the tahini with pomegranate molasses could not disguise. Labneh was refreshing but could have been thicker. The scene stealer was dessert, out of baklava the lovely waitress suggested knafe, a baked cheese with syrup and chopped pistachios which was the perfect pairing with my arab coffee.

As an arab and a big fan of Mansaf, this place has the worst mansaf ever. TBH, the meat was very good but this is not a mansaf. I tried mansaf in arab countries and Jordanian and Palestinian restaurants and it is totally different. Here is how it is not mansaf: 1) the milk that is served with mansaf should be Jameed. Jameed has a very different taste and its color is more yellow than white as you can see in the picture. Also, it does not have the taste of Jameed. It seems to be a regular milk. 2) there should be a special kind of bread under the rice called sherak bread. They used a regular bread which is catastrophic. The sherak is a thick kind of bread that does not dissolve from the milk as you can see from the picture. Also the place is extremely expensive. The mansaf costs $49 and it was the worst. Also they add a credit card fee although this very high cost. I tried to complain but the manager was not there as she left. I don t know how the manager leave before the restaurant was closed. I was extremely hungry and I didn t think to complain earlier. The mezza appetizer was ok except that red thing that is shown in the picture, it was tasteless. I don t recommend to try the mansaf and the mezza plates. I didn t try other plates, may be they are good. **************************************************************** UPDATE after the restaurants owner reply: Anyone can check mansaf pictures over the internet and they can see the difference. Regarding the owners reply, TBH, I miss-explained when I said that sharak is a thick bread. Yes it is a thin bread but it never completely dissolve from the milk. Also, I said that they were not using sharak bread, and they used a regular bread as you can see in the picture, the owners ignored this comment and replied to a small detail which is the sharak is a thin or thick bread. Regarding the milks color, I am skeptical that it differs from one place to another, I tried it from different restaurants and different arab cookers from different cities and all of them are more yellow and thicker. May be the owners are correct but personally I have never seen something like that. It was like a regular milk. Also, notice I am saying like, I am not accusing that it is a regular milk. Anyway, it does not matter. The most important thing that matters is that the restaurant owners didnt even try to apologize or try to approach to understand my concerns more.

My opinion of the food have changed since the first time I visited the restaurant. Most appetizers on the menu are worth a try so you don t need to hold back; Falafel, hummus, kibbeh, etc. are all great. Main dishes are mostly presented as a shared item for the table, very suitable for family-style dining and large gathering. First thing that comes to the table is always their freshly-baked bread with olive oil and mixed seasoning. If you sit at the bar, you can see the bread in the making, make sure to ask for a fresh one there. I tried the mixed shawarma & cheese flatbread and the fattat lahma the first time I visit; to be honest, they were not my favorite. I thought the meat was very dry on the flatbread and even still dry with the sauce on the platter. Yet, I gave al Badawi another chance and I found myself happily cleaning the Ouzi Beef platter. The meat is juicy, melting in your mouth; the rice with the almonds creates such combination of soft and crunchy texture that gets you addicted.

When we arrived she asked if we could eat fast because they were closing in 40 minutes. I just thought that approach was uncalled for considering we called prior to make sure us coming was okay. Also she was hesitant to seat us and when she did she gave us the menus and said do you know what you want before we even opened the menus. Her approach could have been more Hi, were so glad to have you! However we do close in 40 minutes so I want you to be aware your dining experience may be a little more rushed than usual. Anyways we ordered with another waitress who never mentioned the closing time. The place wasnt packed but we werent the last people to leave. There were three other tables who stayed past closing which made me feel like the experience with the hostess was unnecessary. She seemed a little younger than me and I get it, at the end of the day you want to go home, but you can be kinder about it because part of dining out is the experience with the staff. We were tired and had trecked from New Jersey and heard amazing things about this place, and how warm and friendly everyone was.

Its not easy maintaining food quality during periods of high volume. Food was so-so. Service was inattentive and lacked professionalism. It wasnt a terrible experience, it was a we expected better from the establishment, they simply did not deliver. Heres what we ordered. Everything was  prepared fresh and was cooked well. The issue was seasoning and flavor. If the food had been flavor we would have been satisfied and would have forgone the not so excellent service. But this wasnt the case. Heres what we ordered: Chicken Ouzi, of the dishes we ordered this was the best. It had the most flavor, was cooked well and had the best presentation. Ive had this dish before all throughout the country and in Palestine. It was underwhelming for what it could have been. Not terrible but not something Id reorder if the competition in Brooklyn can deliver a better version of this dish. Zatar with olive oil, where was the side of olive oil? Our table didnt receive any. We asked again the servers mustve forgotten. Dish was prepared fresh however it was not as tasty as it could have been. Again if I know spot that can prepare this dish with more consideration than Im going to the competition. Lamb Mansaf, heres where we were really let down. The lamb was cooked to perfection, it fell of the bone was tender and wasnt dry at all. The problem? There was absolutely no flavor. None whatsoever. It was as if we had requested a no seasoning, no spice version of the dish. Why spend $38 on a lamb dish with no flavor when the competition could blow you out of the water for $25? Unfortunately we were disappointed. I wanted more from Al Badawi and Im sure they can do better. Their staff was busy and they were working hard. I dont want to undermine their dedication to their craft, lets focus on improving the flavor in the dishes. Food that tastes phenomenal has a lasting impact on the customer. You eat something delicious and you tell your friends, co workers, business partners, and family members to come eat here. I cant make that recommendation just yet.

I saw her making a phone call and she came back to us to confirm it was hand slaughtered so we decided to stay. We were then assigned a different waitress after being seated. When ordering fatoosh, the menu didn t mention anything about  sumac  (you can take a look) so when I asked the waitress if there was any in the salad  I had to repeat myself a few times to which she said  I don t know what that is   I said never mind and ordered it anyway.

We were expecting a dessert menu but no dessert or drinks menu (only water) which was a bit disappointing. Overall I give it 3 stars due to the rude / unattending service.

One typical supermarket sized pita bread to share for 2 people is not sufficient for the dip like appetizers on offer. We didnt mind paying extra for more bread though since we are all aware of the inflation at the moment. We asked for more pita for the muhammara and the server brought us just 1 more pita bread. Lamb fattah is one of my favorite dishes, but this one was a let down. It was very dry and the lamb was overcooked. Ill just stick to Ayat for fattah.

ChIJL_1fstBbwokRVaeht7CPayA,al Badawi,4c3a5ab621011ba5fae48a9cd2b544a2,5,"I m a fan of Ayat so to say I was excited about Al-Badawi opening up in downtown Brooklyn. would be the understatement of a lifetime. I willingly make the trip out to Bay Ridge from Manhattan without even thinking about it. But now I can get the same incredible food with a shorter trip. What really makes this place stand out is the quality of the food, the hospitality of the staff and owners, and the incredible decor. So basically it excels at everything is what I mean to say. I started off with the mezze platter, which is a must order at here and Ayat. They don t just make one great dip, they make a variety of great dips. Great? I mean amongst the best I ve had anywhere. They also serve a freshly baked pita along with them, which seems better here than Ayat - likely because it s coming right out of the pizza oven just feet away. As a main, I had the Maklouba, which is such a unique and satisfying dish, I wonder why I only just recently discovered it. I wish I would have known about it before but I m glad I know where to get it. This dish is really special - it can t be started to be prepared until ordered due to the preparation of the dish. A dish truly worth waiting and traveling for. So what really differentiates this place from Ayat is the setup - both are beautifully decorated, but this one has a little more to it as part of a more casual sit down place. I m glad they added this here, as I ve seen a number of reviews for Ayat mention some confusion around the ordering. No need to worry here. I truly think this is one of the best restaurants in NYC and really anywhere. There s so much more I want to try here (and will), from the pizzas to the main meals to the fresh fish selection prominently displayed. It s also nice to have the BYOB option here - the meals go great with a nice red wine. And they provide some nice cups to drink from. Oh and the dishes they serve in are awesome, just like at Ayat. What ultimately really gets me going about this place is the hospitality. I spoke with the owner outside after the meal for 10 minutes, discussing how incredible his restaurants are. All night, he was handling orders, working in the kitchen to make sure everything moved perfectly. He told me about how special these places are and what it means to be able to introduce so many people to this cuisine. Such a friendly man, such a great chef. I look forward to talking with him each time I visit as I can tell how much effort and hard work he puts in to making this place as amazing as it is. It s also great to see that the owner of nearby Yemen Cafe (another great restaurant) is co-owner here. He was also as involved the night I dined in to make sure everything was moving along just right. As I type this review out, I really can t wait to go back and bring more people.

I felt that overall the quality of the food wasn t very impressive. It really could ve been much better. I had the mixed shawarma platter and I felt that it could ve been much fresher and warmer all together. The flavors weren t very strong in my opinion. However, there were many things impressive about this experience overall. For starters, the restaurant is incredibly spacious for one of Brooklyn s prime locations. The decor and aesthetics of the restaurant are phenomenal! More importantly, the servers provide excellent service. Upon being seated, I was provided with complimentary olives, olive oil and a spice mix along with water served in their traditional jugs and cups. Furthermore, they provided me with not one but TWO complimentary generous service of fresh pita bread. I generally don t like pita bread, but there s was incredibly unique and flavorful. And finally, I found that their portions were incredibly generous. While I ordered one platter, I was barely able to finish half! And it was priced at only $16. While I wasn t entirely impressed by my order, I felt that many other dishes ordered by those around me such as Mansaf and baked chicken would probably be better. I will definitely be returning to explore more of their menu!",2 years ago,2022-03-04 12:20:02.564051,,,,0,33,3,False,,
