We recently tried the DatMacPatty, a veggie patty bursting with the delightful combination of warm mac and cheese, spinach, and cheese, all enveloped in a soft coco bread   a true flavor explosion that exceeded our expectations! Additionally, the Drake DatMacPatty, featuring goat curry and baked mac and cheese encased in a Caribbean-styled beef patty, was a taste sensation like no other. The choice of warm cocoa bread elevated the experience, making it a must-try for anyone seeking a unique and delicious dining adventure. The ambiance was welcoming, and the staff provided excellent service. Datz Deli has certainly carved its niche in bringing innovative and mouthwatering Caribbean-inspired dishes to Queens.

I believe the restaurant needs to get it together. There s too much promotion and hype around this restaurant. The restaurant cannot support  due to its small confinements and lack of additional ovens. I waited on the line for over two hours outside , then it started pouring so they decided to let everybody inside. The hostess or staff that was given time estimates was giving in correct time estimates and we ended up waiting more time because the patties were sold out by the time we got to the door. While inside the store and placing our orders, we still had to wait due to only one person making patties for the entire restaurant. That was very inefficient And made the process even longer than it had to be. Also, the person making patties was not changing gloves and was cross contaminating chicken, shrimp, beef, etc. luckily I am a person that is not allergic to anything so I didn t mind personally, but anybody else was a vegetarian, would have been annoyed if they saw that, I blame TikTok and Instagram for the over hype of this restaurant and I hope the restaurant gets it together as far as meeting the demand of the people who are willing to wait over two hours for some patties.

Once we got in we were told that it would take 10-20 min food but ended up being ready in more than an hour for 5 sandwiches. The most irritating thing was their menu said $6 for their datmacpatty. But thinking I was gonna pay a certain amount ended up paying 60+ for barely any oxtail and bland tasting food. Don t waste your money here at all it s terribly not worth it.

ChIJF8bnGFdhwokRY2l-tONBN90,Datz Deli,922ec1640e6c876f8194072eb024974a,4,Honest Review. The hype for the Dat Mac Patty is a bit overhyped. I tried it for the first time and have to say with cocoa bread is good but without cocoa bread was a lot better. Wish they had given me extra gravy for the one with cocoa bread because that was kinda dry and second there wasn t enough oxtail meat. I actually thought they forgot to give me oxtail but when i fully opened it there was some in the back. I was expecting way more for $12 per patty. Other than that i like that everything is made from scratch. Fresh handmade patties. Mac was good. Oxtail had good flavor and spices. The only other con was the wait time. I expected maybe a 30min wait but even after getting in the door and ordering it took another 20-30mins. Is it worth the wait  i leave it up to everyone to experience it on their own.,9 months ago,2023-06-28 16:55:04.899916,,,,11,11,11,True,,

I got the oxtail Mac patty. Honestly I was hoping for excitement in flavor and to have a Caribbean feeling and taste and to be honest there was no flavor and I believe they are a little gasp up. The food is overhype and I would prefer a regular beef patty with coco bread and cheese at a regular Caribbean spot. I didn t enjoy it and I was sadly disappointed. I was hoping due to their following on social medias and their videos on people waiting in line and how they make it, it s really not that good at all. If you prefer taste, I don t recommend this place at all. If you want to try it out you can try it out some people might like that but it s overhyped. And for 12 dollars it s not worth it either. The workers were there were nice but I believe this gotta be a NY thing. If you do go there, good luck trying it!",4 months ago,2023-11-28 16:55:34.408735,,,,2,3,2,False,,
