This place filled up quickly and had long lines but we were lucky enough to get a table right when the restaurant opened at noon. I ordered the Spicy Kimchi Tofu Stew ($15.99) and my girlfriend ordered the Perilla Seed Tofu Stew ($17.99). Both stews were super flavorful and fulfilling. Portion sizes were nice and the banchan tasted great too (they give refills without you asking too). Service was amazing and they even gave us an additional small bowl of rice for free after watching us trying to scrape the remaining rice into our plates. Overall, I would rate this place a 9/10 - service, food, atmosphere were all amazing and the menu looked great.",

I recommend going for the lunch special so you can get a main dish with a stew for $19. The service was OK   I wouldn t say it was bad but I expected better.

Not sure why other reviews had given such high ratings. I ordered a seafood tufu stew myself and also seafood pancake to share. The octopus in the tufu stew was way overdone (like a rubber too hard to chew).  The seafood pancake was very good. Anyway, I really dont like the servers hurring us to leave by asking us twice if I had finished eating while I am still working half a way on my seafood tofu. Finally I let them take away my food finishing only two third.  Sure, it is a busy restaurant and there is often a long waiting list but when we walked out at about 7:30pm I noticed no more waiting customers because it was raining outside, then why bother hurrying us to finish the dinner! Not quite a pleasant experience at the end!",

                "review_text": "I was fooled by the Korean review. (I was shocked when I visited after seeing a recommendation from Navers famous travel cafe Susasa) The seasoning is very strong and the side dishes are very salty. I went there because I wanted to eat warm food. From what I can tell, this is a good restaurant in Korea?? Have you ever been to places that really don t taste good? Or maybe you are used to salty food from Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do... I have the taste of a Seoul person. I ordered bean curd stew and mushroom pot rice... I was surprised because it felt like sugar and Miwon were added to bean curd stew. (It doesn t have the smooth, savory feeling of tofu restaurants in Korea ..) There are 5 side dishes provided. Bean sprouts and spinach are salty, and the thin stone pumpkin that feels like raw radish is so salty that you spit it out? The only things I could eat were the sweet stir-fried dried shrimp and the spicy braised tofu  . The spinach was salty, but for health reasons (in New York, you cant eat healthy food other than cold salads...), I soaked it in soybean curd, washed it, and ate it. Shocking to see that 2/3 of the soybean curd is pork... ; I left all the meat I ate. The mushroom pot rice was cooked just right, but it had a fishy smell from the mushrooms, so I ended up eating only 1/4 of it. I am a housewife for 13 years. Good cooking skills. Since Im a gourmet who loves good restaurants... if you ask me if I recommend this restaurant, Id say absolutely not. (If you are curious about my baseline, Hamo in Apgujeong or Danbi in Hannam-dong are my standard restaurants, so those who read reviews should note that. I like Bongpiyang and Byeokje Galbi.) Definitely. Order went in at 11.52. The bean curd came out in 10 minutes! The mushroom pot rice did not come out even at 12.15. I ate seasoned side dishes and bean curd without rice for over 10 minutes... When I asked when the food would be served... At first, the server wearing a mask said,  It ll be here in 2 minutes,  but later he said,  It takes a long time,  and I was offended by the sarcasm. This is the first time Ive seen a restaurant that doesnt serve rice and stew together. It seems like a lot of people come here  because it s cheap  to live in New York. If you can afford it, I recommend you go somewhere else I think it will remain as a very bad memory because I wasted a precious meal in New York. I have no idea if I should tip. At other restaurants, I left 22%, but here I left 10% less. I was surprised to see a receipt suggesting a 20-25-30% tip    .This is a restaurant that uses a lot of spicy meat that is seasoned unconditionally to suit the tastes of locals. ah  And I was a little shocked because they cleaned the entire store with bleach.. When I first went to lunch time, the smell of bleach filled the air. From a business owners perspective, that would be the most reliable way to sterilize... ; I wondered if everything from the plastic water cup to the earthen pot had to be washed with bleach... I couldnt hide the feeling of discomfort while eating it. Its a house that doesnt meet the strict standards of Koreans these days.",

In the case of pot rice, unlike regular rice, it starts right after ordering, so it takes time, and the time the customer visited was right after opening, so there was a slight delay in ordering due to multiple orders being placed at once. For cups and bowls, we use a high heat treatment washing machine rather than bleach. We will reflect your opinions and become a better restaurant in the future. thank you",

I get that it s supposed to be a Michelin-star restaurant, but when a Korean restaurant doesn t even provide an initial side of rice with their dishes, that s crazy. Charge for extra bowls of rice, sure, but an initial side of rice should be a given, especially at these prices. Not to mention, the food was just ok. The servers were all very nice though! But in my honest opinion, you can get far better tasting food and a better selection of banchan for less cost at other Korean restaurants in the area - and with rice. (We love our rice, ok)",

The side dishes was very good and my favorite by far is the tofu and the pickled radish with seaweed. The spicy pork and tofu dish was very flavorful and the pork was very tender, sweet, and flavorful. They re tofu in this one is also good. The stew was also flavorful and a good amount of spice. It s very comforting and pairs well with the rice you get. Cho Dang Gol is known for their homemade tofu and in this one visit I tried like four different tofus and each one has its own unique taste, texture, and flavor which is very interesting. My favorite one by far is the one in the side dish. I came in Tuesday a few mins before 12, which is their opening time, and there was already a few people there. It gets busy quite fast so I would recommend reserving a seat or come early. Overall I love this place and would definitely come back again and try more of their menu.",

Before we even got our tofu soup, the starters almost blew me away. The raw tofu to start off simple followed by a variety of common tofu house staples like radish kimchi, sweet potato, and spinach. Each of them couldve been dishes on their own and tasted better than most tofu house places. The tofu soup itself was also very hot and hearty and wonderful for a cold day, though (unpopular opinion) I liked the tofu soup at BCD Tofu House slightly better. The mini Yakgwa cookies they gave at the end also couldve been desserts on their own: delicious buttery sweetness!",

I am addicted to their banchans (best kimchi ever). I am sad they are no longer on seamless but I plan on going in person soon! Go try this place and fall in love with korean food!

But it s so delicious. The beef is very soft and goes well with the rice. And the egg roll is very dense and delicious! The tofu soup is quite ordinary, but if you like tofu you can give it a try~ It just feels like cooking at home.",

I wish Hand Hospitality served Hojokban s aged kimchi at all their restaurants. It s literally the best kimchi ever.

By the time we seated a little past 12, there was a wait list forming, so be prepared to wait if you dont get the first seating! The best item I ate by far was the fried pollock! It came with a tofu stew in a lunch combo, which was great. Whats also nice was a small dish of marinated beef was part of the free banchan, which you dont usually get from other restaurants. The homemade tofu was interesting and worth a try. I personally prefer less crumbly tofu for my stews after trying it, though. One negative was the hot stone bibimbap wasnt hot enough, which didnt crisp up the rice at all. Not worth it for the hot stone vs cold bibimbap.",

I ordered mini bossam, stir-fried octopus bulgogi, seafood soft tofu stew + dumplings, etc. The kimchi that comes with the mini bossam is delicious, and the basic dumpling filling is really delicious. Soft tofu and hand tofu are really savory and delicious. Octopus is slightly sweet, but it really sticks in your mouth and is very delicious when eaten with rice. I really enjoyed eating it. It feels a bit expensive compared to the price, but even with that in mind, I think Ill eat it again. Especially when Im sick, I feel relieved when I order soup and eat it with rice.",

                "review_text": "90 minute wait for 2 people. There was an iPad at the entrance to sign up for the waitlist. There s also an app you have to download to view your waitlist status, which will update you to return to the restaurant to be seated. When we were at the top of the queue, we went to the reception desk and were quickly seated. The table was shared with another couple with a tall divider in the middle of the table for some privacy. The server was friendly and gave us sufficient time to decide what we wanted to order. The lighting was a bit dim and it was a bit cramped. Side dishes were alright. The tofu was surprisingly good, albeit a little dry. No fishcakes, but they did have kimchi, pickled cucumber, broccoli, and a few other things that weren t too memorable. For our appetizers, we ordered the Mini Bossam and the Seafood Pancake. The Mini Bossam was disappointing. There were 10 pieces of bite-sized pork belly. It came with a small side of kimchi and 2 sauces. The pork belly was boiled but did not have much flavor to it. I also thought the sauces did not complement the pork belly. The Seafood Pancake was good with a crispy texture. I would definitely recommend trying the Seafood Pancake if you want an appetizer. For our entrees, we got the Bulgogi and Vegetable Tofu Stew. The Bulgogi was good but a little dry and salty compared to other restaurants in the area. It was also expensive for the amount of meat that you got I believe it was around $33 for the Bulgogi. As for the Vegetable Tofu Stew, although it looked promising when it was served, it was not spicy nor flavorful. There were no meat options and came at a set spice level. The broth was very watery and diluted the taste. For me, who has a low spice tolerance, I did not find the dish spicy at all. Overall, I thought Cho Dang Gol was an overhyped and unnecessarily expensive restaurant. Service was quick but the long wait time and mediocre food made it not worth the time investment.",

While the service remained its usual stellar self, the food was a heartbreaking disappointment. My beloved Kimchi Soybean Curd Stew (    ) had lost its richness, diluted to a pale version of its former glory. The Cod Roe Omelet (      ), too, seemed almost shrunken, its once vibrant filling reduced to a meager whisper. Whether its a change in chefs or a cost-cutting directive, the soul of my once-favorite restaurant seems to have dimmed. There will always be a part of me that holds this place dear, a relic of its past gastronomic brilliance. But with its current state and inflated popularity, I sadly cant foresee a return in the near future. ----------------------- Easily my favorite Korean restaurant in NYC. Both of the bijijjigae is delish. Their tofu is handmade and it translates in their tofu-based dishes. Ambience is nosy and crowded, but that makes me nostalgic of the restaurants of my hometown in Korea. Customer service is always so so so great. Not a single bad time! :)",

There s always a long queue (they don t take reservations so there may be waits of up to an hour plus for a table of 2 during peak times) so we decided come for a late lunch/early dinner to give this place a try. Food was unfortunately not worth the wait, especially for the price. The stone pot rice was too moist (so there weren t any crispy rice bits at the bottom of the pot). The sliced pork appetizer was ok, nothing to write home about. The tofu curd soup had an unusual texture, almost like congee, and lacked complexity. Another thing that I didn t like was that the restaurant layout   many of the tables were shared between two party of diners (separated by a divider), and servers had to squeeze between tables to serve diners that were seated on the inside part of the table, next to the wall. This disturbed our dining experience, and was also quite annoying as they sometime pushed the jackets off the back of the chair and onto the floor.",

                "review_text": "A popular Korean restaurant known for their home made tofu. I ve gone 3 times this year with large groups of friends/family. It really is best in a large group because it s family style and I always like to order different dishes. There is almost always a waitlist (no reservations). You have to go to the restaurant and add your name to the list. You can download their app to see what place you are in the line. If I m with people visiting NYC, I usually take them to the Macy s building or Bryant Park (if there are 50 tables ahead of me). The food is obviously fantastic. My go to s are buckwheat pancakes (crispy, soft, salty) and the beef bulgogi pot. The spicy baby octopus and bulgogi plate is also delicious but very spicy. The roe omelet is another crowd favorite (soft, delicate with a dash of umami flavor from the roe). The staff are efficient and move quickly. The hosts, up at the front, are friendly and try to move things along swiftly and try to do their best to estimate the wait time.",

The restaurants interior was snug with closely seated tables and felt very cozy. CDG had a wonderful Banchan selection, with unique items like the cabbage with fermented snails and tofu pieces. The Bossam was had a wonderful pork flavor without being overpowering, and the mini Bossam served as the perfect portion size for two. The beef bulgogi with octopus was well stir-fried and seasoned. The Perilla Tofu Soup had a distinct grainy taste that might cater more to acquired palates. Overall, the dining experience was fantastic and left us incredibly satisfied. The complementary Korean fried Yakgwa cookie that came with the bill was a thoughtful touch.",

Be sure to check the approximate times when listing. Rice is not included in all dishes, but pot rice is provided for $2 regardless of the number of dishes, so be sure to add it. It costs $2 per pot and serves about 2-3 people. The side dishes are also nice and recommended. Tips can be selected starting from 20%.

Very watery as a result instead of saucy like you can eat with rice. Tofu soup was ok, but again rather simple in preparation. Service was quick and frequent. Restaurant atmosphere is top.

We got the lunch sets, which were a pretty good deal and come with a mini portion of entree of choice and soup of choice. We got Bulgogi and Spicy Seafood Stew, and Spicy Pork and the Bean Curd Stew.

We waited 90 minutes until we got seated. There are places to visit (stores and ktown) while you wait. Banchan: The free sides provided tasted good. Especially the spicy tofu. They do free refills. We ordered the following items: Seafood Pancake: One of the better seafood pancakes I have had. Taste was good and texture was nice. Did not come out burnt/too crispy. Mini Bossam: This is the appetizer version. Comes with two sauces and kimchi. The kimchi was good. The two sauces were underwhelming. The porkbelly was cooked properly but lacked seasoning so it was tasteless. Not worth the 20 dollars especially since it was ~ 10 pieces. Bulgogi: Bulgogi was cooked nicely and the sauce was good. Did not come out dry. Although the bulgogi was better than other places, dont think it justifies the overpricing. Vegetable Tofu Stew: Huge disappointment. Would advise against getting the tofu stew here. They do not have a meat option with the soondubu (only seafood or vegetable or kimchi). There is only one spice level/mode. Stew was not seasoned and the soup just tasted like boiled water. Overall, recommend coming here once for the experience but I dont see myself coming back as the food does not justify the price and long wait.",

We went two days in a row with almost a third and fourth day. My folks who are picky with Korean food were talking about it literally all day. Order the galbi jjim (big enough for two), the kimchi Biji Jigae, the buckwheat savory pancake (trust me on this one), japchae (glass noodles). Make sure you order the rice which they make in real time and then afterwards pour water for  nurungee . They also make their own tofu in house. If you have room you can also get the spicy pork and tofu dish. Our service Jungmi (?) was incredible and the best. Enjoy our new favorite Korean place prob in the world so far and we ve been to many. We are addicted. It s a problem.",

The food comes out very fast and side dishes are unlimited. The tofu soups are delicious and even the side dishes. If you want a twist on the rice, try the mushroom rice. It was really good. They give you a stone bowl of rice to share so before going crazy and ordering 1 rice per person, ask the wait staff how much rice youll need to order as 1 bowl can be shared if not everyone eats a lot of rice. They have good lunch combo options and I got the spicy jeyook pork with tofu. Portion is very small but with all the other food you get it was actually perfect.",

You cant make reservations, so its walk-in only. Come to the store, receive a reception number, and wait. And its common to have to wait in line for an hour. But its really delicious. Theres Macys and a cafe nearby, so its easy to kill time! The moksal and pancakes here are the best!

Our appetizers and main dishes then came to the table and we re really happy and satisfied with the taste and quality of the food here. You should definitely try the seafood scallion pancake, cod roe omelette, bulgogi beef, and, spicy chicken tteokbokki. Many people said that the sundubu jjigae is great too, but it lacked flavor during our visit. Probably it was just a miss at the time. At the end of the night, we were served with top-tier kimchi and biscuits that tasted like glazed donuts! With great food also came great service and vibe. Our waitress was very kind and attentive - she d always smile while talking to us which we really enjoyed. The restaurant played good jazz music, so it made the dim-lit place feel very cozy. Again, thank you so much to the manager and the crew for resolving our past issue and also for taking care of us. We really, really appreciate it and would definitely come back soon.",

Our group of 6 ordered the cod roe omelette, seafood and scallion pancake, cdg spicy chicken, seafood tofu stew, beef bulgogi with rice. And you bet they were all spectacularly delicious! Come here for the soft and silken homemade tofu that s like a gentle hug in your mouth. And the tteokbokki in the cdg spicy chicken is the softest and the best tteokbokki I ve ever had, I didn t even know that it could taste that good. The banchan were tasty and plentiful. My favorite is the eggplant banchan and they are very generous in refilling our banchan. A plate is never empty for more than one minute when our sweet and friendly server, Liz would top it off with more banchan. And oh my goodness, their service is hands down amazing. They really care about their customers and would work hard to give you the best experience you ve ever had. Liz, our server, is the sweetest and bubbliest person ever. She engaged with our whole group and radiates warmth and sunshine to everyone she talked to. Being served by Liz makes me feel like I m having a home cooked meal at my grandma s house. Our banchan bowls and water cups were never empty as it was constantly being topped off with more food and water, just like a grandma would do. And what brings this all together was the manager, Hyun. He works hard to make sure our experience was the best and it truly was! There was a miscommunication that happened before this but he was quick to resolve it. He made sure that we were well taken care off and that we left the restaurant with our bellies full and feeling happy. He was a gracious and generous host and we are so thankful for everything that he s done for us. Thank you manager Hyun, Liz and the Cho Dang Gol team for the wonderful meal. We will definitely come back when we re back in town! P.s. our friend loves the atmosphere and the jazz music played in the restaurant while we were dining Dietary restrictions: Very accommodating towards my allium allergy",

The food was really good and a really good value too especially with all the variety of side dishes that were included! The only reason I have to give 1 less star is because I was told there was kimchi in the buckwheat pancake but I couldnt really taste it AND I really have a high high bar for Korean pancake from what Ive tried in downtown Vancouver near Cardero and Robson where they have one with cheese although adding cheese might be kind of like cheating to make anything taste really good.. I did love everything like the menu (and how its conveniently shared outside) and the whole experience which was totally worth the wait so I hope Cho dang gol continues to grow.

But the bossam, was good but would not recommend from here. Also wanted to add their side dishes were unique and were also top notch. Absolutely coming back to try their other dishes!

The Jejugo meat noodles were really steamed and light without any seasoning, and my child loved them so much that he even ate them with rice. The budae stew was refreshing thanks to the generous addition of perilla leaves. The rice is also small pressure cooker rice, so it tastes good. It tasted like eating in Korea. They kept refilling the various, less salty side dishes, and I was impressed by the service they took with care even though my child was young. I think this is the best Korean food in the U.S. that suits local tastes. Kid-friendliness: The side dishes and main menu are varied and not too salty, so I dont think it will be a burden for young children. Bulgogi, meat noodles, tofu, etc.",

The banchan was good, they serve a shrimp with zucchini (super good), fish with wintermelon, lotus root with Mayo sauce, and bok choy. They also give a sample of their plain tofu before your meal. I had the spicy seafood tofu stew which I found a bit too salty and the seafood flavor wasn t very strong. the tofu texture was pretty curd-like which I know they re known for but I can t say I was a huge fan. The spicy galbijim was not bad. My friends tried their signature tofu stew but weren t fans of it and preferred the galbijim. The service was great, and they refilled our banchan regularly for us. Overall I probably wouldn t return again for their tofu, but I would try other dishes.",

The waitlist when I got here was quite long but after about an hour or so of waiting a table opened. Staff here move fast and the food came out one by one quickly afterwards. The reviews mentioned they offer you a homemade tofu starter but I didn t seem to get one. The regular banchan provided were all delicious and featured kimchi and lotus root among others. I ordered a pear makgeolli which is made in house and it was super smooth. Food wise I tried the cod roe omelet which comes covered in a green tea mayo and is super flavorful. For an entree the spicy kimchi tofu stew was a hit.",

The whole chicken was brought in whole, disassembled, and there were about four chicken legs in it. The abalone didnt even look fresh. I felt bad about what I ate and felt sick to my stomach after eating it. I had to go to the bathroom because I was sick and had diarrhea. The price was $38. Plus, I feel even worse.

I usually get the kimchi biji but this time we got a mix of other things. The Bo Ssam, vegetable rice, seafood dukbokki and the myungran gryeran maree. It was all tasty but they charged us $2 when we asked for more lettuce wraps for the bo ssam. Unfortunately that s the problem when people find out about your favorite food places  they start charging for everything to make sure people stop lingering and they can get as many people in and out. Just take thing to keep in mind that you ll be rushed in and out. So great if you just want a really good meal, but be prepared to be not so gently pressured to eat fast and go.",

I got on the waiting list for a party of one and waited only about 20 minutes. They had a convenient service, where I received a text when table was ready. Place was packed full of people. The tables are separated with a divider so that a four-person table can fit two separate pairs of two. Ive never really tried authentic Korean food before so I was unsure what to order. I did know that they make homemade tofu so that was a must-try. Once the service took some time before my order was taken. Thats understandable they were extremely busy. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. A nice assortment of complimentary starters were provided and all very tasty. I have very little idea what each one was. I ordered the grilled tofu appetizer platter, and spicy chicken entree with a side of mushroom rice that I totally did not need. All of the food was so tasty, so delicious and beautiful at the same time. The spicy parts had just enough heat to my liking. The flavors were through the roof. Warning though I was sweating and eyes watering by the end of my meal. I would chalk that up to the extreme overeating I did. I absolutely loved the heat level. The tofu platter came with cold pickled octopus which was so delicious enough to eat on its own. Also came with some interesting sweet seaweed and kimchi, assumption was that I should be layering these things on each piece of tofu. Was a very good assumption, great combination of flavors. The spicy chicken dish was fantastic, and very filling. The side of mushroom rice came out an extra cost and was more food than I needed, but pretty tasty from what I enjoyed. Id say the prices were just right. Appropriate for what youre getting. I cant wait to come back and try something new. Highly highly recommend this restaurant.",

We ordered samgyetang today and was halfway through it before we noticed that the chicken thighs were bleeding and was raw inside. We flagged down our waitress who apologized and tried to bring the manager over. He refused to even walk over. He was not busy. He simply told her to strike out the item and throw away the dish. Our waitress offered to bring the dish back to the kitchen to cook it a bit more which we agreed to because we didnt want it to go to waste. I was still willing to pay for the dish if it was brought back. She brought it back to the kitchen and we waited. Five minutes later, she came back to say the kitchen threw the dish away and she will strike out the item and asked if we want something else from the menu. She apologized repeatedly. Throughout this whole time, the manager was simply standing at the back of the restaurant doing nothing. We paid for the other items and left. Raw chicken is extremely unsafe. Do not come here. Well miss this place a lot. What a sad way to end this once great restaurant.",

Ive been to places famous for soft tofu and many other Korean restaurants, but Chodanggol was the most delicious. The staff are so friendly (very, very friendly) that it feels like a family run business! The taste was great and I enjoyed all the foods you recommended~!! For some reason, I dont give everything a 5 star rating, but this was a really pleasant meal. There were a lot of fun things to do. Tofu is famous, so I ordered dishes containing tofu! The staff s recommendation is Biji Jjigae! And Jeyuk Kimchi Tofu? It was a menu like that, so it came with a piece of tofu on the side. The biji stew was really tastier than the restaurants I had in Korea! especially!! The side dishes were so good. Seasoned spinach, braised tofu, kimchi, etc. were all delicious. I asked for a refill and they brought me everything I needed!! You almost have to pay for the side dishes haha. And the rice is scorched.. Its a hundred and a thousand times better than the ones in famous places around Jonmateng (I wont specify what it is, but its a famous restaurant). For the last dessert, we also had mini Yakgwa, but I ate so much that I held the Yakgwa in my hand. Anyway, its really  recommended The service is really great and the food is great!",

They say you can judge the quality of a Korean restaurant by the side dishes they bring out and this restaurant is proof their side dishes were amazing and the mains proved to be as well. I did wait almost 2 hours to get seated on a weekday night, so I definitely recommend you figure out an alternative option as I don t recall if they accept reservations.

If you are a student or a foreigner, you may not know this, but the quality and hygiene of the food seen by housewives was very poor.",

                "review_text": "The restaurant was extremely crowded and busy, yet their service and efficiency were legit. The food quality is undoubtedly worth the fame of a Michelin restaurant. Most surprisingly, the price is very affordable! My Korean friend said the taste of Cho Dang Gol is Americanized, so it may not be the most authentic spot in Korean standard. Highly recommend their weekday lunch combo  set. $19.99 for a mini stew and mini main, but they arent mini at all! The portion is indeed smaller than dishes from the regular menu, but it is still very filling that I have to take away boxes of leftovers. They also serve complimentary homemade soybean curd and 5-6 banchans before your mains. Perilla Seed Tofu Stew I miss this stew so much so I come back again. My Korean friend recommended this stew last time, and it was life-changing. He said perilla seed stew is a common dish in Korea. The perilla seed was so aromatic and earthy. The stew has a hearty portion of homemade tofu, sliced rice cake and mushroom. Some may find it a bit plain comparing to spicy kimchi stew. If you cant tolerate much spice, you will find this very delectable. Beef Bulgogi The marinated bulgogi was stir-fried with onions and mushrooms. It was well seasoned and quite sweet. Perfect match with a bowl of rice. Cod Roe Omelet It tasted more like Japanese tamagoyaki rather than a Korean dish. The omelet was very soft, creamy and jiggly. The green tea mayo was slightly subtle, yet complemented with the savory cod roe fillings. ***Walk-in only. If you want to guarantee a table, make sure you arrive before it opens (12pm) My Recommendations: Perilla Seed Tofu Stew, Baby Octopus & Beef Bulgogi Worth Returning ? YES",

And the restaurant had excellent vibes. We were a party of 2 and shared a table with another 2 people, but there was a privacy divider in between and worked beautifully. It was pretty packed for a Wednesday at 6 pm, so come at a non peak time!",

Seafood pancake is delicious, really recommend the cod roe omelet. The menu says the rice served 3-4, not true, serves 2 max. Huge shoutout to the young lady who waited our table.

Ordered take out plenty of times too. The restaurant setting is lovely in a traditional Korean wood house. Really liked that we could upgrade to fancy up the rice that comes with the tofu soup. The mushroom rice and vegetable rice were both very nice with well cooked grains. The mushroom rice was the only sugar free item on the menu that my husband who cannot have refined sugar could eat. The servers were all friendly and efficient. Highly recommend!",

                "review_text": "Fantastic food. Its hard to describe because there doesnt appear to be anything particularly special or unique about the dishes they serve, at least in presentation. But all the dishes are very, very well made, and they hit the spot as down-to-earth Korean comfort food. I have a few complaints, but I still highly recommend Cho Dang Gol if youre just interested in the food. Here are my complaints: EDIT: I have changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars, since I first wrote this review. I went during off-peak times, and the service was great - and of course, the food was still excellent. I felt that 4 stars would be dragging their overall average down, below what it should be. So, if you go, I recommend either coming very early or arriving after peak lunch hours. 1. The restaurant is crowded/cramped. I guess its too popular. As a result, service was mixed. On one hand, service was extremely quick to refill our waters and take away finished dishes. On the other hand, it felt like they were trying to rush us out. Bad form: the server didnt wait for us to finish, get up, and leave before taking the check and looking at our final tip. She as soon as I signed and wrote down the tip, she swooped in and took the receipt tray. 2. This is just my personal preference, but the one thing I didnt love was the kimchi. I believe they make their kimchi with oyster, which is not my favorite. Everything else tasted great; I just wish they served a more classically fermented style of kimchi. Im sure they could do it well. Thats about it for my criticisms. The price is very fair for the quality of food. I will be coming here regularly   definitely a new favorite spot",

We order a special pancake, some stew, and of course the bossam with some rice. You get free tofu that they make in store and some sides. The sides and tofu were great. They tasted traditional and had no overbearing flavors, except maybe spice. The tofu tasted like soy milk and was not too firm or silken. The food on the other hand, was a bit disappointing. The soup was good, but the bossam was a bit of a let down. There wasn t anything inherently bad about it, they gave a nice portion and it was plenty fatty, but there wasn t anything special about it either. The pancake was ok too, nothing special about it. To be fair, if you enjoy traditional korean foods, this place might be for you, but the mediocre taste along with the wait and expectations from all the hype just led to a let down. If I do come back, it ll be try the soups and side dishes along with the tofu. Also the rice, the rice was nice.",

We got the beef and mushroom japchae, hot stone bibimbap (tofu & veggie), and beef bulgogi. Had a small, small portion of leftovers to take home. They give you a little chewy biscuit w/ the check on the way out. The food is fantastic. They give you 5 banchans and a complementary serving of their house-made soft tofu. As other reviewers have said, its not a gimmick or flashiness that entices you, but just phenomenal, great quality food served hot and quickly for you. For our table for 2, it was actually more space than we needed. The table had a small extension length to the side, so we had more than enough space. But the restaurant is loud and tables are close together. I thought service was great, but probably because it was earlier in the night (floor still packed). To-go, we asked for a box, bag, and a serving of one of their banchans (side dishes), expecting that we could just box it in with the rest. But, they brought one to us already packed up and warm, which was a pleasant surprise! And then, one of the servers walking by opened our bag for us just in passing, a small but appreciated gesture. Great place to stop by. I dont know how it compares to other Korean restaurants in the area, but I left very happy and hoping to come back. Vegetarian options: in-house tofu and tofu centered options! should be okay (but Im not certain). Kid-friendliness: saw them setting up a table with a high chair",

Liked all four dishes we ordered, while my friend s and my favorite is the Baby Octopus & Beef Bulgogi - the spicy sauce has the right balance of spicy and sweet, the octopus and beef were decent quality, and there is rice cake! Just a perfect Korean dish to me from every angle. The Spicy Seafood Rice Cake is sweeter, while the Spicy Seafood Tofu Stew is spicer. The pancake is nice, too. The tofu from the free small dish set was too salty - this is the only complaint I have. The line is always long - get prepared to hang before get seated, but it s not that bad at around 5pm on a Sat - there were 15 groups in front of us but we got a table in probably 10-15min (maybe our small group size of 2 helped).

Instead of smiling or being like  hey thanks for waiting  the hostess literally just said  are you both here?  which in of itself wasnt necessarily rude and so I just said Yes and then she turns to grab some menus and starts walking towards the back, but then she just suddenly STOPS walking like 2 seconds after grabbing the menus, and then without turning around to speak to us, without any explanation, she just randomly reaches over to this table on her right hand side near where we are all standing and she takes the dudes credit card, and runs their bill for them, while my wife and I are just standing awkwardly behind the lady in the middle of us supposedly being taken to our table. And keep in mind there s no talking to us from the hostess there s no  oh sorry I just have to ring these people out / sorry I just need to run this tables bill I forgot to do it earlier and they have been waiting  there was just silence , and no explanation for her doing this in the middle of her taking us to the table. Thankfully our server was super friendly and spoke to us a little bit about being from Korea and so on and so forth. The food was amazing. Its really sad that their front of house is that abysmal. I almost just got up and left without ordering any food I was so angry at how the hostess treated my wife and I",

Not sure if it was because it was later in the evening or just by luck but docking a star for that I got the Maesangi Oyster Tofu Stew and it was so good! All the flavors and textures blended perfectly together and the few bites of tofu I did get were so silky and smooth! Would recommend :) Also tried chestnut makgeolli for the first time and it was good but I don t have any other reference points. Would definitely recommend this place and come back again!",

The portion was decent, beautiful plated. They gave lovely side dishes, and my rice had charred side effect from the hot stone bowl, though my takeaway was in plastic bowl. Impressive!

Chloe looked after my friend and I, and I have to say she was the most amazing waitress I ve ever met! The food was 10/10   we had the Korean fried chicken, spicy pork & tofu and the pork belly & kimchi! The service was quick and helpful, Chloe gave us suggestions on food and drink and even showed us how to eat our food like a true Korean! One bite, one drink   thank you! Will be back ASAP",

Recommendation: Cod Roe Omelet. I ordered 3 dishes: mini bossam, cod roe omelet, and homemade soybean curd stew. The homemade soybean curd stew is amazing and I highly recommend everyone to try it. The waitress recommended the third option of it: rice with mushrooms. The cod roe omelet is also great. The omelet is good for 2 people~ The mini bossam mix the pork belly, sauce, garlic, green pepper, kimchi, and some tiny shrimp together. Not sure where they put the salt, it is a bit salty for me. The meat itself is at the right tenderness. Location: convenient. 2 blocks away from Korean way. Waiting time: This restaurant is very popular. We made reservation at 5 p.m. and waited 30 minutes to be seated. Price: $65 for 3 dishes including tax and tips. I am very full. Nice. Service: super friendly. A lady helped me to mix bossam and scoop mushroom rice. She also said I am cut =w= That makes my day. Thank you. Overall I enjoyed my dinner a lot. I recommend everyone to try this restaurant. Delicious food, friendly service, and competitive price. I will come back for the soybean curd stew again.",

Cho Dang Gol is rightfully renowned for its tofu, which is top notch and served as a (free) appetizer along with their traditional banchan dishes (see first two photos). We ordered the two dishes that are probably most representative of their tofu prowess: the kimchi  soybean curd stew and the spicy pork and tofu (see last two photos). Both stew and the pork had the right mix of savory and spicy, highly recommended. Its the perfect restaurant for a casual but high-quality traditional meal.",

The person in charge of our table cleaned up our empty plates without asking, and brought us our bill in the middle of the meal. He must have felt that we were uncomfortable, so he ordered a Hispanic server to keep asking if we had finished eating and if he could clean it up. Its been a while since I went to talk, but it was very uncomfortable. Food was good even though it was pricey. For foreigners, price might be okay bue for Koreans, it is too much even in New York City. I was there yesterday with my friend and server pushed a lot to get out ASAP. The line was very long and I had been waiting for 1 hr to get in. I didnt finish my dishes but the server already took them and gave us a bill in the middle of meal.

I ordered several dishes with my friends and they just took the scorched rice without saying anything. I thought they would put it in a bowl and give it to me again, so I waited, but since the table was crowded, they just took it away. If you go during busy times, honestly, its better not to expect any service. This is generally the case in Korean restaurants, but all my American friends who went with me were displeased with the pushy service.",

First, I ran out of side dishes, so I asked for a refill, but it didnt arrive even after 20 minutes. When I asked for it again, they said they couldnt bring it because they ran out of side dishes, so they responded with something else and brought it to me. It was okay up to this point. But I looked at the table where other foreigners were sitting, and they actively served us side dishes. I was surprised and thought they were discriminating against me because I was Korean. Second, when I usually eat dinner in the evening, they give me rice soup as a service, but this time, they just give me the main meal without that. I dont know if the service has changed, but if so, please let me know. Don t customers have the right to know that much? Lastly, and related to the first, we did not understand why the service was so slow for us while they took orders and delivered food quickly to foreigners or customers who had just arrived. I wanted to pass it off as there were a lot of people that day and it must have been hectic, but when I went to another restaurant, the service was fast even though it was very crowded. The food didnt come out quickly, and if I needed something, they didnt bring it to me right away, so I was very disappointed this time. This is my fourth visit to Chodanggol, and I dont think there will be a fifth visit in the future... I think its difficult to improve the quality of service, but its easy to go down.

We came 15 minutes before opening on a Sunday for lunch and there was already a line forming. The space is packed with seats but they were filled pretty much immediately after opening, and I could see that everyone was racing to order first. They certainly have their operation down to a T. The menu had a lot of interesting dishes that I havent seen before. In order to properly compare with what Ive had at restaurants in America in the past, I ordered the seafood tofu soup. We also got the seafood pancake. I thought the banchan were very good and authentic. The seafood pancake ($18) was a bit disappointing. It didnt have the chewy texture that Ive come to expect. The amount of seafood was pretty small and the shrimps in particular were very tiny. It felt a bit greasy as well. Overall I wouldnt get this again as I felt that it was a lot of dough and not enough seafood -- for that price, I would expect more seafood. For the seafood tofu soup ($16.99), I enjoyed trying the mix of the different textures of tofu that they make in-house. I liked the texture of the tofu an I generally liked the seafood that was in the soup, particularly the baby octopus. However, I thought was a bit sweet and not very rich and deep. I do prefer the BCD soup for its intense and strong flavors. The soup at CDG was pretty mild in all aspects of flavor and definitely not my favorite tofu soup Ive had. I also had the mushroom rice ($4) which seemed like mostly rehydrated shiitake on top of rice (the mushroom selection in the menu photo looked much more diverse and plentiful). It was good but nothing I couldnt make at home. If I came back, I would definitely want to try the oyster maesaengi soup or one of the other options that you probably cant find anywhere else in the area, maybe even the US. I think the key is to come here before it opens so you dont have to wait too long, and also to order something that you wouldnt be able to get elsewhere.

Im sure theres a reason for the long lines and hordes of Korean customers, and I suspect its because of the special dishes you cant find anywhere else.",

Following 2 separate visits within the same week, I can confidently say that Cho Dang Gol serves the BEST Korean food I ve had  without the need for a plane ticket! As a solo traveller, it can sometimes be tricky dining as a Party of 1. Thankfully, the service here is exceptionally friendly and welcoming, and they place dividers at your table to give you a sense of privacy from other diners. During both my visits, I ordered and ate far too much food for one person  but I simply couldn t help myself. Everything was hot, fresh, and delicious. The banchan (complimentary side dishes) were also great. They even recognized me upon my 2nd visit, which made me feel even more at home. My recommendations include the fried chicken, seafood/scallion pancake, dumplings, fish pancakes (a rarity in North American Korean restaurants), as well as the soft tofu soups (their tofu is made in-house)! To the staff at Cho Dang Gol, thank you for treating me like family and sharing your space and recipes with me. I hope to return ASAP on my next visit to NYC! Kamsahabnida",

I placed an order, but the dish I ordered wasnt served, so I checked to see if my order had been placed, but the order wasnt delivered properly, so I was surprised a second time. When the food came out and I ate it, I was surprised three times because it tasted completely different from what I expected from the reviews people had left. The bill came out, and unlike other stores, the tip % was displayed in descending order, so anyone who glanced at it had no choice but to pay a high tip. I came back surprised four times.

Many Korean patrons, which always speaks to the authenticity of the food, and people like me who fell in love with K-dramas!  The 5 side dishes, kimchi, which are complimentary, were very tasty.  I had bulgogi (barbecue beef), and my friend had bulgogi with octopus.  Both were delicious, although the one with octopus was a little spicy, which enhanced the flavor.  We also had dumplings and soup, a well-rounded meal, I would say.

It s not a lot of money, but it just goes against the principle of Korean food/jeong to charge for rice. Knocked off one star for compromised integrity :( Honestly, this is the restaurant I want to gatekeep, but it s the best representation of true Korean food in Manhattan, so I gotta spread the word. The food is always amazing (and has been for manyyy years), and I always remember to go hungry because I can t have enough of their food. While their main focus is tofu and they do it f-ing well, the menu has a wide selection of food and they re all tasty. The line is always so long, which is why I wish less people knew about this place (lol), but it s so worth the wait. I just put my name down, hang out at nearby shops, and come back when they ping you that your table is ready.",

Whats more ridiculous: on the cheque I wrote for 10% tip, which I think their rushed and unfriendly service deserves. The waitress was rude enough to read the bills by our table and unashamedly asked for 18%!! I gave her that, not wanting to spend one more minute in this disrespectful hell. Never gonna come back.",

But the service was beyond poor, in addition, rude, compulsive and extremely terrible manner. The waitress had her thumb all the way into the bottom of the bowls. She  robbed  the bowl out of my hand   which is the precise word to describe what she did when she saw me trying to put a dish into the bowl, and she  yelled  at us at least two times saying that it was for rice not for dishes. She did the exact same to my friend when she came in  again with her fingers in the bowl and she stacked them up really loudly and bang the stack onto the table. At the end none of us want to use the bowl seeing how much of her hands were in the bowls. It happened again when she just grabbed dishes of my hand abruptly without saying any words when she saw that I was not suppose to do something she saw as right, and then she yelled at us again. I also do not think she realizes she was being rude and she was just trying to say something in a very compulsive manner. I would like to suggest more training for waiting staff  for such a good restaurant to create such a poor experience due to bad service is quite a pity.",

Meat was so tender and I love rice cake and Kabocha in anything. Maesaengi Oyster Tofu Stew was refreshing and the both the maesaengi and tofu was so silky and full of seafood flavor. Bossam was nice and tender, wish they gave some type of veggie wrap. The mandarin makgeoli was dangerously yummy and refreshing and went well with the dishes. They ran out of dessert so coming back to try the sweets and more.",

The food here is genuine and isnt light on the flavors or spice, which makes it stand out and stay delicious after all this time. Its a slightly tight squeeze, but it adds to the atmosphere and thats what makes this place great. Good music that isnt too loud, warm lighting, and cute screen separators for the tables so they can seat smaller parties faster. Get the basaam, mushroom rice, spicy pollock, and the spicy baby octopus! Its great with their bachan, which is all home made",

As for food, my favorites were probably the Spicy Seafood Tofu Stew, Spicy Seafood Rice Cake, and the Galbijim. Although the other dishes we ordered were also great (Cod Roe Omelet, Spicy Kimchi Bean Curd Stew, Autumn Rice) I wouldnt get the Autumn Rice as a main dish, but we ate it alongside our other saucier plates and it was the perfect elevated side dish. Rice texture was great and the vegetables were delicious. My only wish is that the sauce adhered on the meat better for the galbijim, but it tasted so good I didnt mind taking a bite followed by a sauce/broth slurp. YUM Ended with the peach tiramisu which was good but not spectacular. Would 100% return for the main dishes!",

The food was delicious until we found a disgusting piece of plastic in the octopus and bulgogi dish. Not sure what it was used to wrap and it definitely screwed up the experience. Not sure if we ll come again. Spicy budae hot pot: a bit too spicy for us. The tofu in the soup is delicious. Spicy seafood rice cake: the rice cake are tasty and perfectly chewy. Not too hard and not too soft. The portion of seafood is small though. Baby octopus and bulgogi: the beef is tender. Overall a pretty good dish until we found the DISGUSTING piece of plastic",

Seafood soup also tastes very good but might be a bit spicy if you can t handle spice. Pork belly and seafood pancakes are good as well. They advertise their tofu as signature but to me they are just tofu. I ve tried better tofu in Chinese restaurants. The waitress was super friendly. She taught us how to enjoy each dish in the most Korean way (even though she was clearly very busy given how packed the restaurant was). I tried to thank her in Korean when we were leaving and she clearly appreciated my effort  .",

The specialty is the house-made tofu which comes as a free appetizer and is featured in a number of menu items. The tofu tastes very fresh but personally preferred it paired with other dishes vs standalone. Our party is 6 ordered spicy pork & tofu stir fry, spicy rice cake with seafood, budae jigae, soybean cold noodle, and seafood pancake which was more than enough food. Everything was delicious although the soybean cold noodle is an acquired taste (not as flavorful and very soy-forward, understandably). Service is wonderful and very quick, and they ll kindly refill any banchan dishes. The only downside is they serve up the budae jigae for you vs just letting it cook as a communal dish on the table.",

My old colleague and I ordered seafood tofu and spicy chicken galbi, and were given tofu biji (soy pulp) as appetizers, and it was very flavorful for what it was. The chicken galbi will be a bit sweet if you are expecting old school Korean cuisine. Everything in Korea is sweeter nowadays and this wasnt too much compared to that. The service was fast, polite and prompt but we did have to flag them down to get their attention since they are super packed and busy during dinnertime, so if you expect a more attentive American style dining experience, just be mentally prepared.",

The fried fish and spicy chicken were awesome. I can tell that they used different sauces in different dishes so not all of them are  Korean sweet and spicy , but varied in flavors. Really great meal. Invited our friends again next Tuesday night but was told to wait at least 90 minutes so we gave up. So hard to find a restaurant in Manhattan these days!",

I guess this is a restaurant that local people like. It seems to have been catering to the tastes of Koreans in New York since 1997. Your small kindness touched me today.",

Surprisingly, we didn t wait more than 10 minutes! The food was exceptional. It was filling, it tasted homemade, and the amount of banchan (side dishes) they had available were appropriate. I really enjoyed the pajeon. It was perfectly cooked, and the seafood didn t taste rubbery. I appreciated the sauce that came along with it, as it added a touch of acidity to brighten the flavors of the dish. I also liked the buddae jjigae. I would highly recommend eating this during a cold day, as eating this dish will feel like a nice warm hug. I would definitely recommend eating here with a few friends so you can split the bill and try different options. The service was great, as they were accommodating and friendly. Happy eating!",

They re known for their soups so my boyfriend and I ordered seafood soondubu and their current special: oyster seaweed soup. Both were delicious! They were served with banchan and rice cooker in individual pots that was served slightly burnt on the bottom, making for a unique flavor. The soups were served boiling hot. Portion size was perfect. We left full but not bloated. We also ordered the dessert   red bean tiramisu. It was my first time eating that and it was SO delicious. I d definitely recommend it. The restaurant itself was somewhat small, but we were seated right away when we went for a later lunch around 1:45. There is a restroom available in the back. The waiters weren t the most attentive but came quickly when we waved them down. I d definitely come back again!",

The staffs are welcome and speaking Korean which remind me of some Korean drama scenes. We had seafood pancake (I like it because it s crispy and thin, won t get you too full. The ingredients are fresh), spicy hot pot with noodles, homemade tofu soup (sorry I forgot the name) and a plate of fried chicken. All for party of four and we are all satisfying. The food is super tasty and fresh. The staff is attentive and helpful, she help share the portion of the hot pot. Probably the best Korean meal we ve had. They offer side dishes which you can refill. We enjoy each kind of them. Kimchi is extremely good, with a bit sour flavor. Overall, it s a 5-star restaurant. Definitely returning back for other offerings.",

We re seated at the back near the kitchen area of the restaurant which we feel safe because everyone working wearing a mask and there s enough distancing for everyone. I think most of guests with kids are seated in that area, just to be safer for the lil ones. We love our food! It s a 5 Stars for overall of food. Here s our order: Seafood Tteokbokki A plate of spicy rice cake with assorted seafood and gochujang sauce. Oh this is a must try hot items! It s spicy and addictive, once you start you can never stop! Beef Bulgogi Hot Stone Bibimbap It s delicious, and the sauce is the one that deliciously kills, ut has certain taste that keeps you eating! No words to express it better than you try it yourself! Seafood stew (spicy) This one is very good with generous seafood but the stone bowl is too small for a delicious soup! Please serve in bigger bowl, We also love the lady who served us, she s care deeply on us especially to our lil one, our glass never empty when she s around. She took good care on us! The restrooms was cleaned too! We ll be back for more food adventures!",

Overall I preferred the dishes we had for the first visit but it s fun to try new things!!! Visited the 3rd time because cold weather means you gotta eat hot soup.

The tofu appetizer was warm and delicious and the banchan was perfectly seasoned. Usually if the banchan is good, the food is good! Hubbys bulgogi plate was huge. The Korean fried chicken had a thin crispy layer and was perfectly cooked even though the chunks were huge. It came with a dipping sauce side instead of being tossed together which I actually prefer because it gets soggy if its tossed with the sauce. I got the lunch combo with the seafood pancakes and seafood tofu soup. Even though the tofu stew was a lunch portion, it had a generous amount of seafood. Soft octopus, one headless shrimp, one mussel, and one clam. Yummy!! I highly recommend this place if you love Korean tofu stews.",

However staff handled it quickly and seated us when we followed up... service was otherwise great. Was here a few years ago, their service has definitely improved a lot. Not sure if we were lucky or if their sunday banchans are better than other days of the week but we had the best: tiny pajeon, kimchi, spinach, and this really yummy sweet potato/egg/corn mystery mash. They provided extra banchan without asking despite how very busy they were! Ton of bonus points for that. Didn t have to order pajeon! Hot stone bibimbap is not to be missed, makes BCD and Kunjip look inedible! Comes with a tiny dollop of fresh, soft crumbled tofu which I think tops it over the others. Heard their soondobu is top notch, will be back for that next time.",

The bibimbap was good but nothing that blew my mind. I wanted to get the mini bo ssam but unfortunately it wasn t available. They also have weekday lunch combos that look worth the money, would probably try this next time I come here for lunch. Service was great!

The biji jigae and the cham dubus (soon dubus) are all really tasty - the tofu is great and the broths are delicious. I also love all the banchan/little dishes you get at the beginning, plus the small fresh tofu bowls they give you to begin your meal, and the delicious ginger tea at the end, which is very refreshing. But I just cant believe that things like bulgogi or galbi are $27-30 for a single-size portion, or that a bibimbap in a stone bowl could actually be $18-19. The bulgogi wasnt marinated evenly, and the portion being so small given the exorbitant price makes me think I dont want to come back here again. The wait here has also become ridiculous, which makes me want to go to other places to get my soondubu or Korean meat fixes.",

One more thing thats disappointing is that I dont think its polite to take all the tip receipts with you even though the customer didnt even go. Even if you check before checking, isnt it right to organize the tip receipt after the guest leaves? This is my first time at a restaurant that checks the tip amount like this. At the same time, he was busy cleaning up the leftovers from the rest of the tables, so he was busy packing my bag. I thought the side dishes were spilling in my bag..

The kimchi is excellent and tastes so fresh. The bibimbap was super hot and we had it mixed in front of us for us. The army stew had so many nice ingredients and is very filling. The fried chicken appetizer was so tender and delicious too. Id definitely come back! Thanks!",

They had clear dividers between each of the tables, which was great. There was a piece of paper with lunch menu items where we could check off what we wanted, and how many of it we wanted. We ordered the jjamppong tofu stew, perilla seed tofu stew, and dumplings. The dumplings were just ok, but the stews were so delicious. The jjamppong stew was the perfect level of spicy, and the perilla stew was savory. They both came with rice, and of course a true Korean meal wouldnt be complete without the banchan (side dishes). The service was excellent as well. Our server was super attentive, always refilling our empty side dishes and making sure we had everything we needed.",

The group behind this (and other great establishments) has got it right down to the grain of rice. And wow, talk about how much pleasure a humble bowl of rice can bring. The unique preparation of rice at CDG definitely achieves maximum flavor and wonderful texture. The rice is sticky so it clumps easily, perfect for stew. Notice those little graina of what looks like soybean? Thats attention to detail. Once seated, you will be served the seasonal side dishes or banchan, it varies with each visit, but rest assured kimchi is one of them. I am told there could be shrimp in the kimchi sauce, but Ill worry about my allergies tomorrow, for now the kimchi is so fresh and delicious! On to the main course: while I have tried most of their menu before, today I went for a hearty Bulgogi Stew for the cold new york winter. This stew is so nourishing and potent if it does not give you bliss, at least it will offer some nutrition. Pardon the hyperboles but it really is that good. Try the beef bulgogi on a hot plate as well if you like the sizzle. I also recommend the classic pork and tofu kimchi stew. And the spicy or fried chicken. Or bibimbap. Actually you cannot go wrong with any of the dishes here! To aid your digestion after,  the staff will add water directly added to a hot claypot where the scorched crusts of rice are to create the traditional Sungnyung drink. Or if you prefer beer, I recommend ordering a Hite Beer and Shoju to mix a somaek. CDG is one few places that will give you the proper glassware for this refreshing cocktail.",

I was surprised how small bulgogi was considering mini stew was much more than the main bulgogi, but I loved how it taste. Not too sweet but very tasty. Mini stew wasn t mini after all but very good broth with shrimp, mussels, squid, tofu, onions, and an egg. I m most impressed by their kimchi. If the kimchi is good at any Korean restaurant, they re food can t be bad. This is very true! I asked for extra kimchi (which I m so happy I did), and it was DELICIOUS! Very good with bulgogi too! All other appetizers were delicious as well, totally worth a try and this might be my new go to! Can t wait to try other menus!",

The man taking our order confirmed this and we delivered the meal to my aunt. She asked if there was beef and we told her no, that we confirmed it with the staff when placing the order in. This morning, my aunt sent me a picture to thank me for the food and I saw that there was beef in her meal. She didnt think it would be beef since we had confirmed this with her and thought it was other marinated meat and had eaten it. I really hope that after reading this review the staff of Cho Dang Gol will be more fastidious with their future orders & take restrictions seriously, religious or otherwise. Their carelessness violated my aunts religious restriction but if this was a food allergy there mightve been more grave consequences.",

The mixed mushroom and veg pancake was a bit greasy but was delicious with lots of different types of mushrooms, peppers, onions and scallions. It was delicious. The seafood tofu stew is practically on every table so I order it. Tastes good and is filling and best of all, has the homemade tofu. I order the purple multigrain rice vs accept the default stone pot white rice. After scooping you a bowl of steaming hot rice, they pour hot tea into the stone pot so you can finish with rice tea porridge. I didn t need that tonight. Solid food and worth the $35 spent (price with tax before tip).",

The staff is so friendly that they keep coming and asking if we need anything, and even serve soup and rice in our own bowls! The rice is served in a stone pot, and after the rice is cooked, they add boiling water to make it. The water is also savory, like barley tea, and the staff keeps refilling it. They sell various types of makgeolli, and there are a lot of foreigners, and there are a lot of foreigners waiting, so I was very proud! It felt like everyone was eating satisfactorily...   I was touched... The interior of the store was really Korean and clean. I really liked it... I also really liked that it was open and different from other Manhattan restaurants, so it wasnt stuffy. Im going to be in New York for a while and I think Ill keep stopping by!",

Both were great and amazing but I didn t like the rice cake that was in Bulgogi jeongol.  It seemed they just put a lot of it just to fill the stew but the quality of the rice cake was not the best.  In the seafood stew, there was more soup than the fillings. They cook rice in the hot stone bowl and after you scoop out the rice, you pour Boricha into the bowl and make Nooroongji.  That was as a nice touch.  Not many Korean restaurants offer that anymore. I would recommend this place. Tips: Bathroom is Clean No Wi-Fi Servers do speak Korean/English They take cards",

As we were some of the only non Asian people there, I feel we were at least not at a place that just catered to white tourists. And it was pretty darn good! Some things like tofu soup were definitely not bad and I enjoyed, but they were things I felt Id never had before. Which again isnt a complaint, because I enjoyed it all, just a comment on my own food ignorance. So Im glad I got to expand my horizons a bit and have some nice and tasty Korean food.",

I am coming to NY often for business trip and travel and I have tried here with my family and friends several time. It has been my favorite restaurant and I can give 5 start for the food. HOWEVER the one who is getting waiting list on last Saturday evening (7th of December) is very rude and unhelpful. I was alone and looks like she didnt want to accept only one people. She asked me to wait for 1 hour, but she told another group of 4 who arrived a little late for waiting 30 min. On top of that, she passed my turn WITHOUT saying any excuse even if there is place for 2 people. I guess that she wanted me to leave by myself??? It was really unpleasant experience ever and ever.",

Of course, the taste isnt bad, but its typical of a Korean restaurant, and the customer service is indifferent toward Japanese people, so I dont think its particularly good compared to surrounding restaurants. Although the price is low, the tip suggestion on the slip is at least 18%, which is bullish. On the contrary, I dont like being crowded. Not bad, so 4 stars.",

The spicy levels were decent, for  people don t eat spicy food, I recommend not getting the spicy dish because it does have some after kick to it. The reason I give 4 star because of the the greeting service. We were standing in front our their faces for a good 10 minutes and nobody even looked at us. I figure you guys are busy and all with lack of staff and time. But I sure think it would be a great idea for customers to have a line ticket or a greeting of some sort when we come in instead of standing there for 10-20min. But the food deserves a good 4+ star.",

The aunt was very kind, and the foreign servers were also kind, and they served a variety of side dishes and asked if I was missing anything. :( Foreign food didnt suit my taste, so I visited for a series of evenings, but it really wasnt Chodangol. It was hard to eat, so I almost had to return home..... The location is right in front of the subway, so its easily accessible. There are a lot of foreign customers, and theres a wait in the evening, but its 20-25 minutes at most. Its really delicious. One thing I wish is that it would be nice to have a beef stew menu too!!!",

We ordered the cod roe omelet, the CDG Bulgogi (marinated sirloin slices with musroom/onion) and the seafood and scallion pancake. The food comes with complimentary house made tofu and kimchi + other korean accoutrements... I should have opted for the beef and scallion pancake but the omelet and bulgogi were OUTSTANDING. The omelet has cod roe inside which combines with steamed egg texture on the inside of the omelet to give it a nice fluffiness. The bulgogi comes on a hot iron plate and it was marinated and cooked perfectly. Also, try the Summer Unfiltered Rice Wine. We got it to try but ended up loving it.",

While the environment and decor is casual the food is consistent and has high-end flavor. We love so many aspects of the menu that we can come here regular (which we do!) and maintain a nice rotation of foods and not get bored. First off, I cant find another korean restaurant yet that has better side dishes. It is always fresh, and they keep a nice selection of regular vs new items. Since we have so many favorites, Ill rattle off more than a few: Starters - all pancakes, dumplings, mini bossam, fried chicken, japchae. Entree - galbi jim, all bibimbops, all the hotpots/Jeongols, all the stews. This is pretty much 80-90% of the menu! Only weakness in the menu is the dessert. More than half of the times we have ordered it, the mochi was hard and did not taste fresh. My guess is there isnt enough people ordering it so there isnt enough rotation in stock. Very, very minor point. We always observe the waitstaff being consistently friendly and helpful to all. Dont hesitate to check this place out!",

Luckily the host was able to find a shared table with a divider which had some seats open.  The interior is cozy and a moderate volume.  The menu here is full of delicious options, and we ended up ordering the cold black sesame noodles, japchae, kimchi jjigae, and spicy chicken.  Our waitress and the staff were all very attentive and quick to bring the banchan (including their in-house tofu - wonderful texture), top off waters, and overall attend to our needs.  The sesame noodles were packed full of sesame flavor and the noodles had a lovely bite.  The japchae had that smokey flavor and was well proportioned with ingredients.  The kimchi jjigae was spicy and comforting, and the spicy chicken balanced tender chicken with chewy tteokbokki.  They also brought a hot stone bowl of rice, with the ever delightful crispy rice on the sides and bottom, which they add barley tea to, making a refreshing drink at the end of the meal.  We were too full for dessert, but they have several options available if you have room.   Overall prices were reasonable, under $100 including tax/tip for the two of us.  On the way out, the line was out the door onto the sidewalk!  Highly recommend for some delicious korean food in Ktown, but either have a reservation or get here early to avoid a wait!",

The downside is that there is a tipping culture here too. I hope this place changes like other no-tip restaurants.",

They are known for their homemade tofu which is offered as a warm appetizer. On this visit we had the steamed dumplings which were hearty, but delicate. The citrus-soy dipping sauce is delicious! We also had the beef-zucchini pancake and a bulgogi and soup combo. The pancake was savory with a hint of chewiness. The bulgogi was savory but more stewed than charred on a grill. The kimchi-pork tofu stew (bigi) was thick and hearty as this version had the tofu ground up and incorporated throughout. Overall a great and reliably tasty spot in midtown!",

Ive eaten quite a bit of Korean food in New York, but I dont think theres anywhere thats as delicious, plentiful, and affordable as Chodanggol. I am really satisfied and recommend it.",

We went there mid afternoon so not much of a crowd. The servers were prompt, efficient, and responsive. The typical Korean side dishes were replenished routinely, as was the water. The pleasant surprise was that they brought out new side dishes, asking us to try them out. Would most definitely go back when in the city.",

I ate Korean soul food during my long trip to New York, so I ate two bowls of rice each time. Kimchi soft tofu is truly Korean. I also eat a lot of other soft tofu stews. Bulgogi Ttukbaegi has a slightly localized taste. It is too sweet and lacks the unique flavor of bulgogi. It doesnt suit my familys tastes, so Im leaving it behind. The side dishes were really delicious and finishing with scorched rice gave me strength for my trip to New York in the cold winter. When you come to New York, you will definitely get compliments if you buy groceries at H Mart across the street from this house and start with Korean food for breakfast. For reference, I ate until I was full here and just slept in a musical worth 150,000 won lol.",

Love the pork belly slices that you are supposed to eat along with the kimchi, green peppers, garlic, tofu, pickled radish and the accompanying sauces -- yes, stack everything on your spoon and stuff them into your mouth, awesome taste! (sorry i forgot the actual dish name). The mushroom & tofu jeongul was a very delicious comfort food. The beef galbi was also super thumbs up. Seafood pancake and kimchi stew were so-so. Service was very thoughtful and prompt. We had 2 small kiddos at the table so the staff took care to arrange our food away from the kids (amazing how they managed to position so many dishes within such a small space) and they helped portion out the hot jeongul on the side into individual bowls for us so that the big pot need not come to the table. Overall a very satisfying meal and well worth the wait! (We were expecting to wait 30-45min for our party of 8 but thanks to the multiple dropouts in front of us, we managed to get our table in less than 30min! Yay!)",

                "review_text": "This places was delicious! Definitely recommended. I visited this restaurant two times and got take out once on my 5 days stay in nyc. Thats how good it was, it got me coming back for more! Loved the seafood Stew, the flavour was strong and delicious. You can tell they spent a lot of time on perfecting it. The tofu mix in the stew was interesting. They had two types of tofu inside. One was a firmer and more chunky tofu, and the other was a smooth and soft type of tofu. I am not really a tofu eater but the smooth one was so good. Definitely recommend trying the tofu here. Theyre all made in house and super fresh. Ive also tried the bulgogi with squid. This dish was also really good. The meat has a nice charcoal/smoked flavour to it and the seasoning was on point. I also like the fact that youre paying for what youre asking for. Because there wasnt really much fillers in the dish. It was literally meat and squid and some onions but not a lot. It was really worth it. We also tried the bulgogi stew, this wasnt my favourite but it was okay. Its on the sweeter side. The beef was pretty tender. All the side dishes were also delicious. They change up a couple of the side dishes each time I was there. So there was a nice variety whether you dined in or get take out. Ive also tried the yuzu rice wine, this was interesting, a bit icy. Not my favourite but it was okay. Ive also tried the lychee sangria - really liked this drink. It reminded me of a ice wine like taste. The consistency was a bit thicker than regular sangria.",

We had the spicy pork bibimbap and the spicy pork and kimchi pancake both of which were incredible. The place was absolutely packed to the brim, but since the location is pretty big, we waited only around 10 minutes for a table which was good. The prices of the food are a little higher that I wouldve expected, but the drinks were really afforable compared to other places weve tried. Overall, excellent experience. Would return.",

Our waiter was extremely helpful, suggesting we try this instead of that, or to avoid one dish because it is an  acquired taste,  or to try Set Menu #2 instead ordering their home made tofu and rice separately because you get those things in the set menu for the same price. Reasonably priced and delicious.",

I have no problem with it since itll take way too long otherwise. But.. it was a bit cold in the center. All was cooked and it warmed up once I broke it down in the soup. The soup was seasoned. Usually these types of soups come unseasoned so I can season it to taste with salt. It was a bit salty for me. But I have low sodium diet so it mightve been okay for other people. The small dishes were great too. When I went lunch time and the place was about a half filled and kept more came. Staff were pretty busy but the service didnt suffer. As soon as I was done with small dishes, they brought more. By the time I was about to check out, the place was almost filled but they continued to be very attentive. Judging solely by the food I ordered, I think Kunjip has better whole chicken soup. An overall, it was a very satisfying lunch!",

Later he called us not by name but as three people, obviously the name was not there but my act reminded us of him.

                "review_text": "Cho Dang Gol was packed on super rainy Friday night at around 7. Luckily, we made a reservation so we didnt have to wait long. For some reason, I thought it was a Korean BBQ place - but its not. It was fine though because they have BBQ items too. Its just that theyll bring it out to you since there arent grills at the table. For five people, this is everything we ordered to share. This was more than enough for us and we had a ton of food leftover: Japchae (stir-fried potato noodles with marinated beef, onions, peppers, spinach, and assorted mushrooms), Seafood Tteokbokki (spicy rice cake with assorted seafood and gochujang), Seafood and Scallion Pancake, LA galbi (grilled beef ribs and mushrooms), Bulgogi (marinated sirloin slices with onions and mushrooms). My favorites were the japchae and the bulgogi, both packed with flavor. The flavor of the galbi was good as well, but the meat was a little chewy. Drinks here are not good. The cocktails are sickly sweet, and the wine is really cheap. Id recommend skipping drinks altogether, or sticking to a beer. Wouldnt mind coming back and trying some of their other menu items (especially those octopus noodles)!",

So taking healthy considerations in to account, this place is good.  My friend and I came a few time years back. Since then, the place had been through some ownership changes as my friend told me. Nevertheless, it looks like that the business is still good. We came back on a Wednesday night a few weeks ago and the restaurant was busy. I would love to come back again, hopefully soon.",

It was the day that Koreans like to eat hot kimchi and/or tofu stew. I have visited the restaurant. I ate Chodang pure tofu stew. Its taste is very close to original Chodang pure tofu stew which I had eaten in Gangneung city(2018 Winter Olympic Games opened) at reasonable price. It is simple , good for health. Those foods made our family s mind and body warmer. Thank you for good food.",

Great selection on the menu and there is a dish called Kimchi Biji which is something you should try if you like Kimchi Jigae. The only thing I dont like around here is that they give you a lot of looks and stop helping you towards the end of your meal. Sort of feels like they are pressuring you to leave. Also, no birthday celebrations here. If you bring a cake, dont expect them to give you plates and utensils. They gave us our cake and left. We had to use our old plates/bowls and clean the utensils ourselves.",

Everything we ordered was filled with great flavor and freshness. This restaurant makes its own tofu and it is incredibly tasty. We had bibimbap, noodles with tofu, soup and a fried pancake. Everything was delicious! The service was really good as well, friendly and relaxed. We will be coming back for more.

Smaller number of banchan dishes served than other restaurants but they are excellent. Service unusually warm and friendly, especially by Korean standards where indifferent service is kind of the norm. Prices are very reasonable for the quality/quantity of food served.

The taste is a bit on a lighter side compare to those restaurants in 32nd street which is too intense and oily sometimes and you have to drink lots of water after a few hours but not here. I love that they have some dishes that Ive never seen at most korean places like beef biji and other soybean soup. I wish they have more menu or cold noodles in summer. The service good. They are very polite and friendly. I love Korean food and this is my new spot right now. Just 2 blocks away from ktown.",

                "review_text": "I really dont understand the high rating of this restaurant as a person having all kinds of Korean food since a little boy. I read the Michelin guide but cannot agree with most part. Sure I give it the credits for being more flexible with the menu to include fried chicken and some other cakes that are not always available at more traditional Korean restaurants. Also for the menu that is better structured in a more course-wise way, so people can simply follow each section to order what they want. But all in all,  the taste is barely average. First, the Bulgogi Jun Gol is toooo sweet without even a slight touch of pepper. Go Chu (chilli pepper) is the essence of Korean food,  just as it is to Mexican. Of course not all Korean food is spicy, but it is almost unacceptable to make a Jun Gol loaded with sugar. The Jun Gol is also spiced with onion instead of scallion, making the beef tasting like black pepper steak instead of Bulgogi. Another traditional entree, Bossam (roasted pork belly) should be served with lettuce to wrap the pepper and sauce and to balance the greasy taste. While the Bossam I ordered was without lettuce. How am I supposed to eat the pork belly with garlic, pepper and the sauce? I probably need very good chopstick skills and a super steady hand. And the taste is just so so.  You can buy a box of Bossam from a Korean grocery store with similar or better taste. Soft tofu is especially mentioned on the Michelin guide, which I think is not worth mentioning. The taste is good. But it misses the natural flavor and the soy texture. Funny the restaurant name is Cho Dang Gol, while the tofu is not anywhere near Cho Dang (artisan) Tofu. You will get better tofu at other tofu house. Last but not least,  the rice wine is flavored up with tangerine and tastes like gin. Again something I do not expect in a Korean restaurant. Id rather go to a bar and ask for gin. The best thing I had was thw kimchi from Pan Chan (small complentary plates) and the seafood pancake. The service quality is only average. Bottom line: May be a choice if you are looking for a casual Korean or for first timers who are not sure about it. If you are serious about Korean food or looking for authentic cousuine, you WILL be disappointed.",

The bulgogi mushroom stew was like liquid candy with meat. Too much sugar was added to it. I shared this with my sister and even though it was a small stew (about the size of a rice bowl) we could not finish it because it was too sweet. We forced ourselves to eat as much of it as we could because the stew was 16 something dollars for a small bowl. Never coming here again.",

I wouldnt be surprised if this restaurant hand makes the noodles from scratch which I believe is the case.  Best noodles ive munched on in New York.  Soup is dense with a milky texture and refreshing. Make sure to add salt for flavor. + Service is fantastic.  Hostess are wonderful and also to mention beautiful.  Waitresses are quick to serve and refill side dishes and water. + Prices are reasonable for the quality and portions. - The wait was 10mins. Only 2 seats in the waiting area.  The rest wait outside.",

Yes, Korean food is still overpriced but here it seemed reasonable for the portion. It was not on 32nd main street and most importantly, we can enjoy eating it without being scurried out even before the meal was finished. I actually had time to chew and converse! Imagine that ... a novelty for most Korean restaurants. The service was typical for most establishments friendly but curt. The banchan here is better than some of its neighbors as was the kimchi(but Im no kim chi expert). The Gam ja Jeon came out as little mini pancakes rather than the large one. It was moist and quite good. We shared the Bo-Ssam which came out in a big wok full of goodness. There was a nice selection of leafy greens for wrapping the delicious pork belly. Overall, I enjoyed my time eating here. Even during the dinner rush we ate, talked and enjoyed the meal , lingering for a while as the food digested all awhile never once did the bill come before we asked and the keep refilling our drink.  I will certainly be coming back here again. Now if they just served Al Jjigae Id be in Heaven.",

I think the tofu at EN Japanese Brasserie is better.  Its not as gritty and much silkier.  The food was overpriced for the area, almost $15 for tofu soup and $20 for sauteed dishes.

                "review_text": "I have a particular weakness for Korean food and soft tofu, which is why its difficult for me to give Cho Dang Gol anything less than four stars. But really, this space is quite the gem, especially given its vicinity to the ever-bustling Koreatown. Its well-spaced and tastefully decorated, and the staff here include some of the friendliest ahjummas Ive yet to encounter. The food? As at most Korean restaurants, we started off our meal with an array of banchan, which included cabbage kimchi, namul, and oijangajji (pickled cucumbers) - a nice variety of sour and slightly spicy bites to whet our appetites before our main dishes came out. I had eventually decided on the Kimchi Jigae, a fiery red stew thats served in a stone pot. Cho Dang Gols comes with plenty of kimchi, soft tofu, and beef, all enveloped in a spicy, rich, and bubbling broth; scoop in several spoonfuls of rice, mix, and youre in for one of the best remedies for a cold and rainy day. My friend opted for the Dolsot Bibimbap, a plethora of vegetables and meats served a top a generous portion of white rice in a hot stone pot. She was happy with the quality and taste of her bowl, and immensely enjoyed the rice cracklings - the slightly burnt, crunchy kernels of rice that were stuck to the edges of the bowl. While I cant speak to what the restaurant is like during peak hours, its probably a better bet than some of the more popular places given its location on 35th Street. And youll want to make the trek of just a few additional blocks, especially if youre craving a comforting bowl on a winter day.",

The fresh tofu given with the panchan was bland but clean just like how unseasoned tofu should taste. The seafood pancake we shared was not crispy and filled with lots of chopped up stuff. I didnt that it had the fake crab meat inside. Could have done away without it. Our seafood tofu food was just ok. It needed more salt but i could not really taste anything because i got mine extra spicy. The ginger tea at the end was very strong and hit the spot. I will come back and try other entrees.",

The first time I tried this place was late night after a great time Karaoke singing with a big group of friends.  I was slightly inebriated so I fell in love with the cute restaurant, bubbly staff and sweet and savory aromas emanating from the kitchen.  But upon returning, sober, with a more disseminating palate the verdict is utter disappointment!  The servings of rice and meat were minimal at best while the additional accouterments were over stuffed and unneeded. I would have liked more meat, rice & kimchi and less of the rest that frankly I didnt eat much of anyways!  The service was slow and the staff wasnt very friendly either.  I grew up with authentic Korean food from Seoul & Taegu so I have high expectations on good Korean food.  I love the location in the heart of Koreatown but Ill keep searching for that authentic down home bulgolgi Im bound to find in Koreatown!",

I would definitely go for anything with their homemade tofu if you like tofu, the bo ssam, and their special ssam gyup sal (essentially their tofu and their pork dishes). Some of their soups/stews are really disappointing-the hae-jang-gook was way off and boring, and the bulgogi stew was way too sweet-and the chap-chae was ridiculously priced at $18! They also tried to charge me for 4 beers when I only ordered 2, so watch your bill. Unless you want what they specialize in, stick with Kun Jip for all around quality, homemade Korean food.",

                "review_text": "This has turned into my favorite Korean restaurant in town. I came here with coworkers, including 1 Korean. While we were seated, we were still waiting for my husband. I was worried they would rush us or wouldnt let us sit down unless the whole party has arrived. To my surprise, they were very patient and let us sit and wait while serving us side dishes. So we ended up ordering first anyway because they told us not to worry about waiting around. We ordered the tofu pots, bibimbop,seafood pancake and stir-fried octopus. The sides first of all, were very fresh and the refills keep coming without being asked. The kimchi tofu pot was amazing! It is even better than BCD in my opinion. The tofu tastes really natural and the broth isnt overly salty. I dont feel so bloated afterwards. The seafood pancake is a little soggy but the ingredients are again fresh and not greasy. The bibimbop on the other hand, is probably one of the best I have had too. It is a little pricy but it is so worth it! The only dish I didnt like as much is the spicy octopus. It felt like it was not cooked through completely. We had to send it back to get cooked again. But it came out much better the second time around. Overall, it was a great experience and surprisingly relaxing. I would definitely come here again.",
