Some customers appeared to be heading inside, leading me to assume that they were paying with cash. I approached the cashier and inquired if I needed to use a different line for cash payments, and he confirmed that I should stay there. I proceeded to order their famous Pineapple bun with pork and ice Hong Kong milk tea. However, he informed me that they didnt sell   iced  , I told him that on your menu have that option. He consulted his coworkers for clarification. The pineapple bun was quite delicious, and I would recommend trying it. I really enjoyed their bun when I returned three days later. This time, I was the fourth person in line to pay with cash. When it was finally my turn, the cashier seemed to ignore me and started packing buns. I understood that it was busy, but she suddenly turned to the person on the other side and took their order. She mentioned that the line started on the side, which was confusing because I had been waiting in line. I also wondered about the people who were ahead of me. She didn t mentioned to them. Nevertheless, I must mention that the line setup and service left much to be desired. The staff appeared rude, unenthusiastic, and disorganized. I highly recommended to them that they consider opening a separate window for cash-paying customers and pick up or create clear signage to streamline the process.

I tried the roasted pork (both steamed and baked) and the pineapple pork bun Personally Id skip the baked roasted pork the next time. It was good, but the other two were way better.

Steamed roasted pork bun- trusty spongy bun with a hefty amount of meat filling. The meat in this one isnt sweet, but savory and it goes really well with the rather bland bun. The texture profile of the spongy, slightly chewy bun with the melt-in-your-gob pork belly is phenomenal! Pineapple pork bun- honestly a great follow up to the steamed bun. This is the only one that had a sort of a crunchy layer on the top of the bun (think chunky glaze) and the meat:bun ratio is good. The sweet pineapple bun pairs really well with the savory pork. The slight crunchy texture is met with a dash of sweetness on your pallate which is followed by a hint of the savory melty pork which feels like a nice island in an ocean of sweetness which is followed by more sweetness, leaving a decisively sweet after taste, unlike the confused baked pork bun.

I told him that the last time i came in, it wasnt mandatory and there was no notice/sign. He said that they just updated their policy and had just put the sign up. Then i told him that tipping is not compulsory, let alone asking for a 16% tip, plus we dont have enough cash on us anyway. He pointed outside and said that one of us can go get cash and the rest of us stay back here to wait. I was getting really annoyed at his attitude because he could have said something like, for this time its ok, but please be aware that this is our new policy and we hope to see you again next time. Moreover, its not like we left him nothing! I just felt like that was GREED and he totally blew his service rating by asking us to stay back and wait as if we were going to run away. After argueing with us for a while (he even challenged us all the way out to the door), he finally said out loud - so all the customers could hear, if you dont want to pay the tips, next time just order take out then. At that point, i was fuming and replied, there wont be a next time as i definitely will not step foot inside this place again. He then stormed off. And we left. I asked my friend if he still wants to go to the ATM to get him the rest of the tips, and he said NO WAY. Thats it. Never returning.

When they were out of the Pineapple bun, not only was I devastated, I had to switch my order, which caused MASSIVE confusion. I suppose it was partially my fault, but the language barrier is a little bit of an issue here. Their English is very good, but not perfect and I had to question why I had five buns instead of four when it was all said and done. How delicious was the food? Three out of the four buns were AMAZING. I had two steamed roast pork buns, a famous bun (the one that isn t steamed), and a  Big Bun . The Big Bun had a very strong flavor. Perhaps my tastebuds aren t as adventurous as I d like to think, but I really couldn t stomach the big bun. It was simply a taste I couldn t deal with. The other 3 were great, though and I am pretty confident that the pineapple bun WOULD have been my favorite if they hadn t run out of it. I love pineapple. Did it fill me up for $5 or less? Absolutely. I was full after just 2 buns. And each bun was $.80!!! You can get a filling lunch for $1.60 total! The Big Bun was $1.60. It wasn t that much bigger AND I wasn t a fan, so that was a bit of a waste, but overall and absolutely incredible value. My total, for a lunch that ended up feeding me for dinner as well? $3.48! (for the first time, a Cheap Eats restaurant charged me tax! But given the prices, it was still absolutely worth it). Conclusion: Mei Li Wah makes the cut for one of the CHEAPEST cheap eats so far.

I instinctively put it in my bug out bag but I had 5 minutes to walk to my next destination so why not try these fresh pork buns on my way. They are smaller than the buns Im used to eating. The filling in the bun is heartier. And by hearty I mean fatty. There is at least 2 pieces of big chunk of fat in the filling.  I had to spit the fat in a not in so inconspicuous way. But, in Chinatown its rude to point but not to spit. But in almost every bite there was a crunch from the glaze of the bread. I also like that the filling is not laced with the red food coloring that is ubiquitous in all Chinese bbq pork. I do like this version of baked pork buns but they are small and I wish they offered more other type of bread. They serve food I will try next time.

Last but not least they are a coffee shop and the coffee is pretty potent, I wouldnt dare drink it black.",11 years ago,2013-03-28 18:50:24.273954,,,,0,8,3,False,,
ChIJM3elBidawokRJKPC55N6pQI,Mei Lai Wah,70b6a77674c00a4f28ac8be79c53d1ec,4,"Mei Li Wah is my go to bakery for pork buns in Chinatown. Its famous among Filipinos.  The workers even joke about it. Theyve got a good sense of humor at Mei Li Wah. There are two types of pork buns offered (baked and steamed). The baked is a golden brown sweet bread while the steamed is a fluffy riceflour dough. Both are filled with pork goodness. Get a dozen. Theyre a cheap and filling snack at under a dollar a piece. Mei Li Wah also sells many dim sum items. I make sure to get the cocktail buns filled with coconut. If youre looking for table service, Mei Li Wah was recently renovated. There are no more cats roaming the premises. Its now safe to indulge in noodles and rice.",11 years ago,2013-03-28 18:50:24.276742,,,,0,959,12,True,,

The service, however, leaves much to be desired. The grumpy attitude that the entire staff seems to be in sets the mood immediately. My waitress tone of voice when taking my order was rather condescending and rude. Everything I asked for was plopped down on the table without care, after which she promptly turned around and walked away. Im not usually so negative on bad service, but that just rubbed me the wrong way.",12 years ago,2012-03-28 18:50:24.281806,,,,0,38,,True,,

OMG they were delicious and now I find myself returning and dropping by that area just for roast port buns. Ive tried a few of the other items there, but my favorite is the baked roast pork bun over anything else on their menu. Each time I go, I normally get at least two and thats with self control, otherwise I might be buying a dozen and finishing it before I even get home. The buns are so popular and its made continuously throughout the day, so everything is fresh and delicious.

ChIJM3elBidawokRJKPC55N6pQI,Mei Lai Wah,b9c6b3ac2d355a1bd9bfe77b788d0163,5,"Originally known as Mei Lai Wah, is now Mei Li Wah. Rarely will you find any antique shops, or antique restaurants around Chinatown anymore, mainly because more hip and contemporary restaurants are taking over. However, there are only a few of these places that still exist, and Mei Li Wah being one of them. What was once an antique cafe, which still is, has gone under a  major facelift to blend with other surrounding restaurants. Despite the changes to a more modern look, this place remains to be the KING of all buns. Mei Li Wah makes some of the best roast pork buns there is. People buy dozens and dozens of their tasteful treats. Each golden-glazed bun is packed with flavors, but the star of it all, are the chopped-up roast porks infused with carmelized onions. Along side with roast pork buns, they also make stellar Don-shan, an egg-like dessert cookie kind of thing. All I can say is that everything they serve is finger-licking-good. They may have a new look to their cafe, but that is not going to stop old-timers from coming back for more of their roast pork buns. Young and old alike, they come here for a chance to experience Mei Li Wahs signature buns. They have remained loyal to people of Chinatown since they have not changed their recipe at all. Lets hope they keep it that way! We need cafes like Mei Li Wah to keep Chinatowns tradition alive. Long live Mei Li Wah and their roast pork buns!",12 years ago,2012-03-28 18:50:24.291497,,,,0,294,,True,,
