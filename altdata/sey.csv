Working in specialty coffee, there seems to be a right of passage that because the product is excellent (the coffee is fantastic) you can be absent of social skills.

He appeared to double down to be so stubborn, letting the coffee cool and waiting for me to approach the counter to ask was it mine. Imagine how good this place could be if the counter staff wanted to create an experience for consumers.

SEY Coffee,5,"We went there as tourists looking for a great cup of coffee. We opened up Google Map, looked for nearby coffee shops and I spotted this place. After I read the reviews I decided this was a definite must. The reviews were pretty much on point as to the quality of the brews.  I mean, I watch the occasional coffee ASMR videos in my social media streams, I own a manual espresso press and I dont mind spending a few extra $ on good coffee. Here I am. The order; a latte with oat milk and a drip coffee made with an Aeropress. We sit down at the counter (no laptop allowed except on a specially marked space) and just watch the baristas work furiously (rush hour for coffee enthusiasts it seems). I have to mention the efficacy of their movements: these are no amateurs. It was like watching a live ballet show, a karate kata of some sort with precise and timed movements. Nobody had to wait for a long time which was surprising given the amount of people vs the amount of employees. Our coffees came neatly presented on a wooden board with a glass of water and with a little card giving a brief history of where the coffee beans come from and the history of the cultivar (it comes with sparkling water but you can ask for the plain non-fizzy kind). The latte was great, creamy, delicate, and just really tasty.  The Aeropress coffee was just as delicious, in fact, it was probably one of the best tasting non-espresso coffee I have ever tasted!  In agent Coopers words:  it is a DAMN fine cup of coffee. The decor is awesome, the plants and the lightwells bring a lot of light in the place. That said, it is not made to lounge and spend a couple of hours sipping on your coffee. Come in, sit down with your coffee, enjoy it and then be on your merry way, filled with joy and zen-like attitude after drinking this nectar of the gods.

However, today the pastry case had no signage so you dont know whats what (except for the obvious cookies). I asked the cashier to tell me whats in the case and he caught an attitude because I wanted to know all of the ~10 pastries. Anyway, we got the jalapeno cheese and the ham and cheese croissant. So yummy! My chai tastes a little off, but my SOs pour over tastes great. Guess they do some things better than others. Overall, we like Sey and will be back.

My friends, who are baristas themselves, recommended I try Sey Coffee out during a recent trip to NYC. I stopped by late morning, ordered a drip coffee and sat down to take it all in. From start to finish it was robust with flavor, unique notes and smooth finish. I decided to purchase some beans to take home, which I enjoyed the subsequent week.

Sey also offers a variety of tea as well as delicious pastries to indulge in with your beverage. I highly recommend the olive oil cake, if they don t sell out before you arrive. The almond croissant is dense and delicious and the scones are also good. The chocolate chip sea salt cookie, is a must try.

This is a gratuity-free shop, meaning the prices for their drinks are all $1-2 higher than what you see elsewhere. It causes immediate sticker shock for me and is a small turnoff. I love the idea of gratuity-free actually, but in practice itll take me some time to get used to. All chairs (other than benches) have no back rest, so it can be uncomfortable to sit for long periods of time. The long bench table I was working at towards the back had a sticky surface.
