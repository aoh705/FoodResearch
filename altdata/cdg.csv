Cho Dang Gol,5,"Korean restaurant located in Koreatown. This place filled up quickly and had long lines but we were lucky enough to get a table right when the restaurant opened at noon. I ordered the Spicy Kimchi Tofu Stew ($15.99) and my girlfriend ordered the Perilla Seed Tofu Stew ($17.99). Both stews were super flavorful and fulfilling. Portion sizes were nice and the banchan tasted great too (they give refills without you asking too). Service was amazing and they even gave us an additional small bowl of rice for free after watching us trying to scrape the remaining rice into our plates. Overall, I would rate this place a 9/10 - service, food, atmosphere were all amazing and the menu looked great.",2024,korean restaur locat koreatown place fill quickli long line lucki tabl restaur open noon order spici kimchi tofu stew girlfriend order perilla seed tofu stew stew super flavor fulfil portion size nice banchan tast great give refil servic amaz gave addit small bowl rice free watch scrape remain rice plate rate place servic food atmospher amaz menu look great,1,0.9595

Cho Dang Gol,4,I m still thinking about the cod roe omelet topped with green tea mayo and the spicy chicken because both of these were especially tasty! I feel like the omelet is an item you must order. The kimchi ground soybean curd stew and spicy pollock were also delicious and the rice was perfectly cooked. I recommend going for the lunch special so you can get a main dish with a stew for $19. The service was OK   I wouldn t say it was bad but I expected better.

Cho Dang Gol,3,"This is a very popular restaurant. Went last night with a friend and waited for 3 mins for a table. Kinda overrated in my opinion.  Not sure why other reviews had given such high ratings. I ordered a seafood tufu stew myself and also seafood pancake to share. The octopus in the tufu stew was way overdone (like a rubber too hard to chew).  The seafood pancake was very good. Anyway, I really dont like the servers hurring us to leave by asking us twice if I had finished eating while I am still working half a way on my seafood tofu. Finally I let them take away my food finishing only two third.  Sure, it is a busy restaurant and there is often a long waiting list but when we walked out at about 7:30pm I noticed no more waiting customers because it was raining outside, then why bother hurrying us to finish the dinner!

Cho Dang Gol,3,"I was fooled by the Korean review. (I was shocked when I visited after seeing a recommendation from Navers famous travel cafe Susasa) The seasoning is very strong and the side dishes are very salty. I went there because I wanted to eat warm food. From what I can tell, this is a good restaurant in Korea?? Have you ever been to places that really don t taste good? Or maybe you are used to salty food from Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do... I have the taste of a Seoul person. I ordered bean curd stew and mushroom pot rice... I was surprised because it felt like sugar and Miwon were added to bean curd stew. (It doesn t have the smooth, savory feeling of tofu restaurants in Korea ..) There are 5 side dishes provided. Bean sprouts and spinach are salty, and the thin stone pumpkin that feels like raw radish is so salty that you spit it out? The only things I could eat were the sweet stir-fried dried shrimp and the spicy braised tofu  . The spinach was salty, but for health reasons (in New York, you cant eat healthy food other than cold salads...), I soaked it in soybean curd, washed it, and ate it. Shocking to see that 2/3 of the soybean curd is pork... ; I left all the meat I ate. The mushroom pot rice was cooked just right, but it had a fishy smell from the mushrooms, so I ended up eating only 1/4 of it. I am a housewife for 13 years. Good cooking skills. Since Im a gourmet who loves good restaurants... if you ask me if I recommend this restaurant, Id say absolutely not. (If you are curious about my baseline, Hamo in Apgujeong or Danbi in Hannam-dong are my standard restaurants, so those who read reviews should note that. I like Bongpiyang and Byeokje Galbi.) Definitely. Order went in at 11.52. The bean curd came out in 10 minutes! The mushroom pot rice did not come out even at 12.15. I ate seasoned side dishes and bean curd without rice for over 10 minutes... When I asked when the food would be served... At first, the server wearing a mask said,  It ll be here in 2 minutes,  but later he said,  It takes a long time,  and I was offended by the sarcasm. This is the first time Ive seen a restaurant that doesnt serve rice and stew together. It seems like a lot of people come here  because it s cheap  to live in New York. If you can afford it, I recommend you go somewhere else I think it will remain as a very bad memory because I wasted a precious meal in New York. I have no idea if I should tip. At other restaurants, I left 22%, but here I left 10% less. I was surprised to see a receipt suggesting a 20-25-30% tip    .This is a restaurant that uses a lot of spicy meat that is seasoned unconditionally to suit the tastes of locals. ah  And I was a little shocked because they cleaned the entire store with bleach.. When I first went to lunch time, the smell of bleach filled the air. From a business owners perspective, that would be the most reliable way to sterilize... ; I wondered if everything from the plastic water cup to the earthen pot had to be washed with bleach... I couldnt hide the feeling of discomfort while eating it.

I get that it s supposed to be a Michelin-star restaurant, but when a Korean restaurant doesn t even provide an initial side of rice with their dishes, that s crazy. Charge for extra bowls of rice, sure, but an initial side of rice should be a given, especially at these prices. Not to mention, the food was just ok. The servers were all very nice though!

The side dishes was very good and my favorite by far is the tofu and the pickled radish with seaweed. The spicy pork and tofu dish was very flavorful and the pork was very tender, sweet, and flavorful. They re tofu in this one is also good. The stew was also flavorful and a good amount of spice. It s very comforting and pairs well with the rice you get. Cho Dang Gol is known for their homemade tofu and in this one visit I tried like four different tofus and each one has its own unique taste, texture, and flavor which is very interesting. My favorite one by far is the one in the side dish. I came in Tuesday a few mins before 12, which is their opening time, and there was already a few people there.

Cho Dang Gol,3,"90 minute wait for 2 people. There was an iPad at the entrance to sign up for the waitlist. There s also an app you have to download to view your waitlist status, which will update you to return to the restaurant to be seated. When we were at the top of the queue, we went to the reception desk and were quickly seated. The table was shared with another couple with a tall divider in the middle of the table for some privacy. The server was friendly and gave us sufficient time to decide what we wanted to order. The lighting was a bit dim and it was a bit cramped. Side dishes were alright. The tofu was surprisingly good, albeit a little dry. No fishcakes, but they did have kimchi, pickled cucumber, broccoli, and a few other things that weren t too memorable. For our appetizers, we ordered the Mini Bossam and the Seafood Pancake. The Mini Bossam was disappointing. There were 10 pieces of bite-sized pork belly. It came with a small side of kimchi and 2 sauces. The pork belly was boiled but did not have much flavor to it. I also thought the sauces did not complement the pork belly. The Seafood Pancake was good with a crispy texture. I would definitely recommend trying the Seafood Pancake if you want an appetizer. For our entrees, we got the Bulgogi and Vegetable Tofu Stew. The Bulgogi was good but a little dry and salty compared to other restaurants in the area. It was also expensive for the amount of meat that you got I believe it was around $33 for the Bulgogi. As for the Vegetable Tofu Stew, although it looked promising when it was served, it was not spicy nor flavorful. There were no meat options and came at a set spice level.

Cho Dang Gol,2,"Edit: Previous attempts were thwarted by hour-long waits, so I finally returned months later, joining the 4:45 PM queue fueled by the restaurants recent surge in popularity thanks to EATER mentions and constant chef endorsements on social media. While the service remained its usual stellar self, the food was a heartbreaking disappointment. My beloved Kimchi Soybean Curd Stew (    ) had lost its richness, diluted to a pale version of its former glory. The Cod Roe Omelet (      ), too, seemed almost shrunken, its once vibrant filling reduced to a meager whisper. Whether its a change in chefs or a cost-cutting directive, the soul of my once-favorite restaurant seems to have dimmed. There will always be a part of me that holds this place dear, a relic of its past gastronomic brilliance. But with its current state and inflated popularity, I sadly cant foresee a return in the near future. ----------------------- Easily my favorite Korean restaurant in NYC. Both of the bijijjigae is delish. Their tofu is handmade and it translates in their tofu-based dishes.

There s always a long queue (they don t take reservations so there may be waits of up to an hour plus for a table of 2 during peak times) so we decided come for a late lunch/early dinner to give this place a try. Food was unfortunately not worth the wait, especially for the price. The stone pot rice was too moist (so there weren t any crispy rice bits at the bottom of the pot). The sliced pork appetizer was ok, nothing to write home about. The tofu curd soup had an unusual texture, almost like congee, and lacked complexity. Another thing that I didn t like was that the restaurant layout   many of the tables were shared between two party of diners (separated by a divider), and servers had to squeeze between tables to serve diners that were seated on the inside part of the table, next to the wall. This disturbed our dining experience, and was also quite annoying as they sometime pushed the jackets off the back of the chair and onto the floor.",2024,popular busi korean restaur live hype long queue don reserv wait hour tabl peak time decid late lunch earli dinner give place food worth wait price stone pot rice moist weren crispi rice bit bottom pot slice pork appet write home tofu curd soup unusu textur conge lack complex thing didn restaur layout tabl share parti diner separ divid server squeez tabl serv diner seat insid part tabl wall disturb dine experi annoy push jacket back chair floor,-1,-0.25

And the tteokbokki in the cdg spicy chicken is the softest and the best tteokbokki I ve ever had, I didn t even know that it could taste that good. The banchan were tasty and plentiful. My favorite is the eggplant banchan and they are very generous in refilling our banchan. A plate is never empty for more than one minute when our sweet and friendly server, Liz would top it off with more banchan. And oh my goodness, their service is hands down amazing. They really care about their customers and would work hard to give you the best experience you ve ever had. Liz, our server, is the sweetest and bubbliest person ever. She engaged with our whole group and radiates warmth and sunshine to everyone she talked to. Being served by Liz makes me feel like I m having a home cooked meal at my grandma s house. Our banchan bowls and water cups were never empty as it was constantly being topped off with more food and water, just like a grandma would do. And what brings this all together was the manager, Hyun. He works hard to make sure our experience was the best and it truly was! There was a miscommunication that happened before this but he was quick to resolve it. He made sure that we were well taken care off and that we left the restaurant with our bellies full and feeling happy. He was a gracious and generous host and we are so thankful for everything that he s done for us. Thank you manager Hyun, Liz and the Cho Dang Gol team for the wonderful meal.

Cho Dang Gol,5,"Stopped in around 3pm on a Saturday. They were extremely busy, there were people waiting outside. I got on the waiting list for a party of one and waited only about 20 minutes. They had a convenient service, where I received a text when table was ready. Place was packed full of people. The tables are separated with a divider so that a four-person table can fit two separate pairs of two. Ive never really tried authentic Korean food before so I was unsure what to order. I did know that they make homemade tofu so that was a must-try. Once the service took some time before my order was taken. Thats understandable they were extremely busy. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. A nice assortment of complimentary starters were provided and all very tasty. I have very little idea what each one was. I ordered the grilled tofu appetizer platter, and spicy chicken entree with a side of mushroom rice that I totally did not need. All of the food was so tasty, so delicious and beautiful at the same time. The spicy parts had just enough heat to my liking. The flavors were through the roof. Warning though I was sweating and eyes watering by the end of my meal. I would chalk that up to the extreme overeating I did. I absolutely loved the heat level. The tofu platter came with cold pickled octopus which was so delicious enough to eat on its own. Also came with some interesting sweet seaweed and kimchi, assumption was that I should be layering these things on each piece of tofu. Was a very good assumption, great combination of flavors. The spicy chicken dish was fantastic, and very filling. The side of mushroom rice came out an extra cost and was more food than I needed, but pretty tasty from what I enjoyed. Id say the prices were just right. Appropriate for what youre getting. I cant wait to come back and try something new.

The portion is indeed smaller than dishes from the regular menu, but it is still very filling that I have to take away boxes of leftovers. They also serve complimentary homemade soybean curd and 5-6 banchans before your mains. Perilla Seed Tofu Stew I miss this stew so much so I come back again. My Korean friend recommended this stew last time, and it was life-changing. He said perilla seed stew is a common dish in Korea. The perilla seed was so aromatic and earthy. The stew has a hearty portion of homemade tofu, sliced rice cake and mushroom. Some may find it a bit plain comparing to spicy kimchi stew. If you cant tolerate much spice, you will find this very delectable. Beef Bulgogi The marinated bulgogi was stir-fried with onions and mushrooms. It was well seasoned and quite sweet. Perfect match with a bowl of rice. Cod Roe Omelet It tasted more like Japanese tamagoyaki rather than a Korean dish. The omelet was very soft, creamy and jiggly. The green tea mayo was slightly subtle, yet complemented with the savory cod roe fillings. ***Walk-in only.

Cho Dang Gol,5,"Fantastic food. Its hard to describe because there doesnt appear to be anything particularly special or unique about the dishes they serve, at least in presentation. But all the dishes are very, very well made, and they hit the spot as down-to-earth Korean comfort food. I have a few complaints, but I still highly recommend Cho Dang Gol if youre just interested in the food. Here are my complaints: EDIT: I have changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars, since I first wrote this review. I went during off-peak times, and the service was great - and of course, the food was still excellent. I felt that 4 stars would be dragging their overall average down, below what it should be. So, if you go, I recommend either coming very early or arriving after peak lunch hours. 1. The restaurant is crowded/cramped. I guess its too popular. As a result, service was mixed. On one hand, service was extremely quick to refill our waters and take away finished dishes. On the other hand, it felt like they were trying to rush us out. Bad form: the server didnt wait for us to finish, get up, and leave before taking the check and looking at our final tip. She as soon as I signed and wrote down the tip, she swooped in and took the receipt tray. 2. This is just my personal preference, but the one thing I didnt love was the kimchi. I believe they make their kimchi with oyster, which is not my favorite. Everything else tasted great; I just wish they served a more classically fermented style of kimchi. Im sure they could do it well. Thats about it for my criticisms. The price is very fair for the quality of food. I will be coming here regularly   definitely a new favorite spot",2023,fantast food hard describ doesnt special uniqu dish serv present dish made hit spot earth korean comfort food complaint highli recommend cho dang gol your interest food complaint edit chang rate star star wrote review peak time servic great food excel felt star drag averag recommend come earli arriv peak lunch hour restaur crowd cramp guess popular result servic mix hand servic extrem quick refil water finish dish hand felt rush bad form server didnt wait finish leav take check final tip sign wrote tip swoop receipt tray person prefer thing didnt love kimchi make kimchi oyster favorit tast great serv classic ferment style kimchi im critic price fair qualiti food come regularli favorit spot,1,0.9379

They tasted traditional and had no overbearing flavors, except maybe spice. The tofu tasted like soy milk and was not too firm or silken. The food on the other hand, was a bit disappointing. The soup was good, but the bossam was a bit of a let down. There wasn t anything inherently bad about it, they gave a nice portion and it was plenty fatty, but there wasn t anything special about it either. The pancake was ok too, nothing special about it. To be fair, if you enjoy traditional korean foods, this place might be for you, but the mediocre taste along with the wait and expectations from all the hype just led to a let down.

We got the beef and mushroom japchae, hot stone bibimbap (tofu & veggie), and beef bulgogi. Had a small, small portion of leftovers to take home. They give you a little chewy biscuit w/ the check on the way out. The food is fantastic. They give you 5 banchans and a complementary serving of their house-made soft tofu. As other reviewers have said, its not a gimmick or flashiness that entices you, but just phenomenal, great quality food served hot and quickly for you. For our table for 2, it was actually more space than we needed. The table had a small extension length to the side, so we had more than enough space. But the restaurant is loud and tables are close together. I thought service was great, but probably because it was earlier in the night (floor still packed). To-go, we asked for a box, bag, and a serving of one of their banchans (side dishes), expecting that we could just box it in with the rest. But, they brought one to us already packed up and warm, which was a pleasant surprise! And then, one of the servers walking by opened our bag for us just in passing, a small but appreciated gesture. Great place to stop by. I dont know how it compares to other Korean restaurants in the area, but I left very happy and hoping to come back.

Just a perfect Korean dish to me from every angle. The Spicy Seafood Rice Cake is sweeter, while the Spicy Seafood Tofu Stew is spicer. The pancake is nice, too.

Instead of smiling or being like  hey thanks for waiting  the hostess literally just said  are you both here?  which in of itself wasnt necessarily rude and so I just said Yes and then she turns to grab some menus and starts walking towards the back, but then she just suddenly STOPS walking like 2 seconds after grabbing the menus, and then without turning around to speak to us, without any explanation, she just randomly reaches over to this table on her right hand side near where we are all standing and she takes the dudes credit card, and runs their bill for them, while my wife and I are just standing awkwardly behind the lady in the middle of us supposedly being taken to our table. And keep in mind there s no talking to us from the hostess there s no  oh sorry I just have to ring these people out / sorry I just need to run this tables bill I forgot to do it earlier and they have been waiting  there was just silence , and no explanation for her doing this in the middle of her taking us to the table.

Cho Dang Gol,1,"My first impression was so good that I always visited this restaurant every time I came to New York, but this time I was very disappointed. First, I ran out of side dishes, so I asked for a refill, but it didnt arrive even after 20 minutes. When I asked for it again, they said they couldnt bring it because they ran out of side dishes, so they responded with something else and brought it to me. It was okay up to this point. But I looked at the table where other foreigners were sitting, and they actively served us side dishes. I was surprised and thought they were discriminating against me because I was Korean. Second, when I usually eat dinner in the evening, they give me rice soup as a service, but this time, they just give me the main meal without that. I dont know if the service has changed, but if so, please let me know. Don t customers have the right to know that much? Lastly, and related to the first, we did not understand why the service was so slow for us while they took orders and delivered food quickly to foreigners or customers who had just arrived. I wanted to pass it off as there were a lot of people that day and it must have been hectic, but when I went to another restaurant, the service was fast even though it was very crowded. The food didnt come out quickly, and if I needed something, they didnt bring it to me right away, so I was very disappointed this time.

Cho Dang Gol,4,"I had heard a lot about this place from my friend so was excited to try it. We came 15 minutes before opening on a Sunday for lunch and there was already a line forming. The space is packed with seats but they were filled pretty much immediately after opening, and I could see that everyone was racing to order first. They certainly have their operation down to a T. The menu had a lot of interesting dishes that I havent seen before. In order to properly compare with what Ive had at restaurants in America in the past, I ordered the seafood tofu soup. We also got the seafood pancake. I thought the banchan were very good and authentic. The seafood pancake ($18) was a bit disappointing. It didnt have the chewy texture that Ive come to expect. The amount of seafood was pretty small and the shrimps in particular were very tiny. It felt a bit greasy as well. Overall I wouldnt get this again as I felt that it was a lot of dough and not enough seafood -- for that price, I would expect more seafood. For the seafood tofu soup ($16.99), I enjoyed trying the mix of the different textures of tofu that they make in-house. I liked the texture of the tofu an I generally liked the seafood that was in the soup, particularly the baby octopus. However, I thought was a bit sweet and not very rich and deep. I do prefer the BCD soup for its intense and strong flavors. The soup at CDG was pretty mild in all aspects of flavor and definitely not my favorite tofu soup Ive had. I also had the mushroom rice ($4) which seemed like mostly rehydrated shiitake on top of rice (the mushroom selection in the menu photo looked much more diverse and plentiful). It was good but nothing I couldnt make at home. If I came back, I would definitely want to try the oyster maesaengi soup or one of the other options that you probably cant find anywhere else in the area, maybe even the US. I think the key is to come here before it opens so you dont have to wait too long, and also to order something that you wouldnt be able to get elsewhere. I dont think the more typical dishes we ordered were outstanding. Im sure theres a reason for the long lines and hordes of Korean customers, and I suspect its because of the special dishes you cant find anywhere else.",2023,heard lot place friend excit minut open sunday lunch line form space pack seat fill pretti immedi open race order oper menu lot interest dish havent order properli compar ive restaur america past order seafood tofu soup seafood pancak thought banchan good authent seafood pancak bit disappoint didnt chewi textur ive expect amount seafood pretti small shrimp tini felt bit greasi wouldnt felt lot dough seafood price expect seafood seafood tofu soup enjoy mix textur tofu make hous textur tofu gener seafood soup babi octopu thought bit sweet rich deep prefer bcd soup intens strong flavor soup cdg pretti mild aspect flavor favorit tofu soup ive mushroom rice rehydr shiitak top rice mushroom select menu photo look divers plenti good couldnt make home back oyster maesaengi soup option find area key open dont wait long order wouldnt dont typic dish order outstand im reason long line hord korean custom suspect special dish find,1,0.9741

Cho Dang Gol,5,"After travelling to Seoul in late 2022, finding authentic, homestyle Korean dishes in North America was at the top of my wishlist. Following 2 separate visits within the same week, I can confidently say that Cho Dang Gol serves the BEST Korean food I ve had  without the need for a plane ticket! As a solo traveller, it can sometimes be tricky dining as a Party of 1. Thankfully, the service here is exceptionally friendly and welcoming, and they place dividers at your table to give you a sense of privacy from other diners. During both my visits, I ordered and ate far too much food for one person  but I simply couldn t help myself. Everything was hot, fresh, and delicious. The banchan (complimentary side dishes) were also great. They even recognized me upon my 2nd visit, which made me feel even more at home. My recommendations include the fried chicken, seafood/scallion pancake, dumplings, fish pancakes (a rarity in North American Korean restaurants), as well as the soft tofu soups (their tofu is made in-house)! To the staff at Cho Dang Gol, thank you for treating me like family and sharing your space and recipes with me. I hope to return ASAP on my next visit to NYC!

When the food came out and I ate it, I was surprised three times because it tasted completely different from what I expected from the reviews people had left. The bill came out, and unlike other stores, the tip % was displayed in descending order, so anyone who glanced at it had no choice but to pay a high tip. I came back surprised four times.

She did the exact same to my friend when she came in  again with her fingers in the bowl and she stacked them up really loudly and bang the stack onto the table. At the end none of us want to use the bowl seeing how much of her hands were in the bowls. It happened again when she just grabbed dishes of my hand abruptly without saying any words when she saw that I was not suppose to do something she saw as right, and then she yelled at us again.

The specialty is the house-made tofu which comes as a free appetizer and is featured in a number of menu items. The tofu tastes very fresh but personally preferred it paired with other dishes vs standalone. Our party is 6 ordered spicy pork & tofu stir fry, spicy rice cake with seafood, budae jigae, soybean cold noodle, and seafood pancake which was more than enough food. Everything was delicious although the soybean cold noodle is an acquired taste (not as flavorful and very soy-forward, understandably).

Cho Dang Gol,5,"If I could give Cho Dang Gol a 6th star I would, mainly for the guaranteed wave of happiness it brings with every single visit. This is as authentic as it gets. The group behind this (and other great establishments) has got it right down to the grain of rice. And wow, talk about how much pleasure a humble bowl of rice can bring. The unique preparation of rice at CDG definitely achieves maximum flavor and wonderful texture. The rice is sticky so it clumps easily, perfect for stew. Notice those little graina of what looks like soybean? Thats attention to detail. Once seated, you will be served the seasonal side dishes or banchan, it varies with each visit, but rest assured kimchi is one of them. I am told there could be shrimp in the kimchi sauce, but Ill worry about my allergies tomorrow, for now the kimchi is so fresh and delicious! On to the main course: while I have tried most of their menu before, today I went for a hearty Bulgogi Stew for the cold new york winter. This stew is so nourishing and potent if it does not give you bliss, at least it will offer some nutrition. Pardon the hyperboles but it really is that good. Try the beef bulgogi on a hot plate as well if you like the sizzle. I also recommend the classic pork and tofu kimchi stew. And the spicy or fried chicken. Or bibimbap. Actually you cannot go wrong with any of the dishes here! To aid your digestion after,  the staff will add water directly added to a hot claypot where the scorched crusts of rice are to create the traditional Sungnyung drink. Or if you prefer beer, I recommend ordering a Hite Beer and Shoju to mix a somaek.

Both were great and amazing but I didn t like the rice cake that was in Bulgogi jeongol.  It seemed they just put a lot of it just to fill the stew but the quality of the rice cake was not the best.  In the seafood stew, there was more soup than the fillings. They cook rice in the hot stone bowl and after you scoop out the rice, you pour Boricha into the bowl and make Nooroongji.  That was as a nice touch.  Not many Korean restaurants offer that anymore. I would recommend this place.

We ordered the cod roe omelet, the CDG Bulgogi (marinated sirloin slices with musroom/onion) and the seafood and scallion pancake. The food comes with complimentary house made tofu and kimchi + other korean accoutrements... I should have opted for the beef and scallion pancake but the omelet and bulgogi were OUTSTANDING. The omelet has cod roe inside which combines with steamed egg texture on the inside of the omelet to give it a nice fluffiness. The bulgogi comes on a hot iron plate and it was marinated and cooked perfectly. Also, try the Summer Unfiltered Rice Wine.

While the environment and decor is casual the food is consistent and has high-end flavor. We love so many aspects of the menu that we can come here regular (which we do!) and maintain a nice rotation of foods and not get bored. First off, I cant find another korean restaurant yet that has better side dishes. It is always fresh, and they keep a nice selection of regular vs new items. Since we have so many favorites, Ill rattle off more than a few: Starters - all pancakes, dumplings, mini bossam, fried chicken, japchae. Entree - galbi jim, all bibimbops, all the hotpots/Jeongols, all the stews. This is pretty much 80-90% of the menu! Only weakness in the menu is the dessert. More than half of the times we have ordered it, the mochi was hard and did not taste fresh. My guess is there isnt enough people ordering it so there isnt enough rotation in stock. Very, very minor point. We always observe the waitstaff being consistently friendly and helpful to all.

The interior is cozy and a moderate volume.  The menu here is full of delicious options, and we ended up ordering the cold black sesame noodles, japchae, kimchi jjigae, and spicy chicken.  Our waitress and the staff were all very attentive and quick to bring the banchan (including their in-house tofu - wonderful texture), top off waters, and overall attend to our needs.  The sesame noodles were packed full of sesame flavor and the noodles had a lovely bite.  The japchae had that smokey flavor and was well proportioned with ingredients.  The kimchi jjigae was spicy and comforting, and the spicy chicken balanced tender chicken with chewy tteokbokki.  They also brought a hot stone bowl of rice, with the ever delightful crispy rice on the sides and bottom, which they add barley tea to, making a refreshing drink at the end of the meal.  We were too full for dessert, but they have several options available if you have room.   Overall prices were reasonable, under $100 including tax/tip for the two of us.

(sorry i forgot the actual dish name). The mushroom & tofu jeongul was a very delicious comfort food. The beef galbi was also super thumbs up. Seafood pancake and kimchi stew were so-so. Service was very thoughtful and prompt. We had 2 small kiddos at the table so the staff took care to arrange our food away from the kids (amazing how they managed to position so many dishes within such a small space) and they helped portion out the hot jeongul on the side into individual bowls for us so that the big pot need not come to the table. Overall a very satisfying meal and well worth the wait! (We were expecting to wait 30-45min for our party of 8 but thanks to the multiple dropouts in front of us, we managed to get our table in less than 30min!

Thats how good it was, it got me coming back for more! Loved the seafood Stew, the flavour was strong and delicious. You can tell they spent a lot of time on perfecting it. The tofu mix in the stew was interesting. They had two types of tofu inside. One was a firmer and more chunky tofu, and the other was a smooth and soft type of tofu. I am not really a tofu eater but the smooth one was so good. Definitely recommend trying the tofu here. Theyre all made in house and super fresh. Ive also tried the bulgogi with squid. This dish was also really good. The meat has a nice charcoal/smoked flavour to it and the seasoning was on point. I also like the fact that youre paying for what youre asking for. Because there wasnt really much fillers in the dish. It was literally meat and squid and some onions but not a lot. It was really worth it. We also tried the bulgogi stew, this wasnt my favourite but it was okay. Its on the sweeter side. The beef was pretty tender. All the side dishes were also delicious. They change up a couple of the side dishes each time I was there. So there was a nice variety whether you dined in or get take out. Ive also tried the yuzu rice wine, this was interesting, a bit icy.

Cho Dang Gol,4,"Cho Dang Gol was packed on super rainy Friday night at around 7. Luckily, we made a reservation so we didnt have to wait long. For some reason, I thought it was a Korean BBQ place - but its not. It was fine though because they have BBQ items too. Its just that theyll bring it out to you since there arent grills at the table. For five people, this is everything we ordered to share. This was more than enough for us and we had a ton of food leftover: Japchae (stir-fried potato noodles with marinated beef, onions, peppers, spinach, and assorted mushrooms), Seafood Tteokbokki (spicy rice cake with assorted seafood and gochujang), Seafood and Scallion Pancake, LA galbi (grilled beef ribs and mushrooms), Bulgogi (marinated sirloin slices with onions and mushrooms). My favorites were the japchae and the bulgogi, both packed with flavor. The flavor of the galbi was good as well, but the meat was a little chewy. Drinks here are not good. The cocktails are sickly sweet, and the wine is really cheap. Id recommend skipping drinks altogether, or sticking to a beer. Wouldnt mind coming back and trying some of their other menu items (especially those octopus noodles)!",2019,cho dang gol pack super raini friday night luckili made reserv didnt wait long reason thought korean bbq place fine bbq item theyll bring arent grill tabl peopl order share ton food leftov japcha stir fri potato noodl marin beef onion pepper spinach assort mushroom seafood tteokbokki spici rice cake assort seafood gochujang seafood scallion pancak la galbi grill beef rib mushroom bulgogi marin sirloin slice onion mushroom favorit japcha bulgogi pack flavor flavor galbi good meat chewi drink good cocktail sickli sweet wine cheap id recommend skip drink altogeth stick beer wouldnt mind come back menu item octopu noodl,1,0.9531

Cho Dang Gol,3,"I really dont understand the high rating of this restaurant as a person having all kinds of Korean food since a little boy. I read the Michelin guide but cannot agree with most part. Sure I give it the credits for being more flexible with the menu to include fried chicken and some other cakes that are not always available at more traditional Korean restaurants. Also for the menu that is better structured in a more course-wise way, so people can simply follow each section to order what they want. But all in all,  the taste is barely average. First, the Bulgogi Jun Gol is toooo sweet without even a slight touch of pepper. Go Chu (chilli pepper) is the essence of Korean food,  just as it is to Mexican. Of course not all Korean food is spicy, but it is almost unacceptable to make a Jun Gol loaded with sugar. The Jun Gol is also spiced with onion instead of scallion, making the beef tasting like black pepper steak instead of Bulgogi. Another traditional entree, Bossam (roasted pork belly) should be served with lettuce to wrap the pepper and sauce and to balance the greasy taste. While the Bossam I ordered was without lettuce. How am I supposed to eat the pork belly with garlic, pepper and the sauce? I probably need very good chopstick skills and a super steady hand. And the taste is just so so.  You can buy a box of Bossam from a Korean grocery store with similar or better taste. Soft tofu is especially mentioned on the Michelin guide, which I think is not worth mentioning. The taste is good. But it misses the natural flavor and the soy texture. Funny the restaurant name is Cho Dang Gol, while the tofu is not anywhere near Cho Dang (artisan) Tofu. You will get better tofu at other tofu house. Last but not least,  the rice wine is flavored up with tangerine and tastes like gin. Again something I do not expect in a Korean restaurant. Id rather go to a bar and ask for gin. The best thing I had was thw kimchi from Pan Chan (small complentary plates) and the seafood pancake. The service quality is only average. Bottom line: May be a choice if you are looking for a casual Korean or for first timers who are not sure about it. If you are serious about Korean food or looking for authentic cousuine, you WILL be disappointed.",2018,dont understand high rate restaur person kind korean food boy read michelin guid agre part give credit flexibl menu includ fri chicken cake tradit korean restaur menu structur wise peopl simpli follow section order tast bare averag bulgogi jun gol toooo sweet slight touch pepper chu chilli pepper essenc korean food mexican korean food spici unaccept make jun gol load sugar jun gol spice onion scallion make beef tast black pepper steak bulgogi tradit entre bossam roast pork belli serv lettuc wrap pepper sauc balanc greasi tast bossam order lettuc suppos eat pork belli garlic pepper sauc good chopstick skill super steadi hand tast buy box bossam korean groceri store similar tast soft tofu mention michelin guid worth mention tast good miss natur flavor soy textur funni restaur cho dang gol tofu cho dang artisan tofu tofu tofu hous rice wine flavor tangerin tast gin expect korean restaur id bar gin thing thw kimchi pan chan small complentari plate seafood pancak servic qualiti averag bottom line choic casual korean timer korean food authent cousuin disappoint,0,0.9732

Imagine that ... a novelty for most Korean restaurants. The service was typical for most establishments friendly but curt. The banchan here is better than some of its neighbors as was the kimchi(but Im no kim chi expert). The Gam ja Jeon came out as little mini pancakes rather than the large one. It was moist and quite good. We shared the Bo-Ssam which came out in a big wok full of goodness. There was a nice selection of leafy greens for wrapping the delicious pork belly. Overall, I enjoyed my time eating here. Even during the dinner rush we ate, talked and enjoyed the meal , lingering for a while as the food digested all awhile never once did the bill come before we asked and the keep refilling our drink.

But really, this space is quite the gem, especially given its vicinity to the ever-bustling Koreatown. Its well-spaced and tastefully decorated, and the staff here include some of the friendliest ahjummas Ive yet to encounter. The food? As at most Korean restaurants, we started off our meal with an array of banchan, which included cabbage kimchi, namul, and oijangajji (pickled cucumbers) - a nice variety of sour and slightly spicy bites to whet our appetites before our main dishes came out. I had eventually decided on the Kimchi Jigae, a fiery red stew thats served in a stone pot. Cho Dang Gols comes with plenty of kimchi, soft tofu, and beef, all enveloped in a spicy, rich, and bubbling broth; scoop in several spoonfuls of rice, mix, and youre in for one of the best remedies for a cold and rainy day. My friend opted for the Dolsot Bibimbap, a plethora of vegetables and meats served a top a generous portion of white rice in a hot stone pot. She was happy with the quality and taste of her bowl, and immensely enjoyed the rice cracklings - the slightly burnt, crunchy kernels of rice that were stuck to the edges of the bowl.

Cho Dang Gol,2,"No impressed.  Although its got cool decour and a fresh y young vibe I dont think Ill be returning anytime soon. The first time I tried this place was late night after a great time Karaoke singing with a big group of friends.  I was slightly inebriated so I fell in love with the cute restaurant, bubbly staff and sweet and savory aromas emanating from the kitchen.  But upon returning, sober, with a more disseminating palate the verdict is utter disappointment!  The servings of rice and meat were minimal at best while the additional accouterments were over stuffed and unneeded. I would have liked more meat, rice & kimchi and less of the rest that frankly I didnt eat much of anyways!  The service was slow and the staff wasnt very friendly either.  I grew up with authentic Korean food from Seoul & Taegu so I have high expectations on good Korean food.  I love the location in the heart of Koreatown but Ill keep searching for that authentic down home bulgolgi Im bound to find in Koreatown!",2012,impress cool decour fresh young vibe dont ill return anytim time place late night great time karaok sing big group friend slightli inebri fell love cute restaur bubbl staff sweet savori aroma eman kitchen return sober dissemin palat verdict utter disappoint serv rice meat minim addit accouter stuf unneed meat rice kimchi rest frankli didnt eat servic slow staff wasnt friendli grew authent korean food seoul taegu high expect good korean food love locat heart koreatown ill search authent home bulgolgi im bound find koreatown,-1,0.9869
Cho Dang Gol,5,"Be careful here, some of the dished are worth it and some arent. I would definitely go for anything with their homemade tofu if you like tofu, the bo ssam, and their special ssam gyup sal (essentially their tofu and their pork dishes). Some of their soups/stews are really disappointing-the hae-jang-gook was way off and boring, and the bulgogi stew was way too sweet-and the chap-chae was ridiculously priced at $18! They also tried to charge me for 4 beers when I only ordered 2, so watch your bill. Unless you want what they specialize in, stick with Kun Jip for all around quality, homemade Korean food.",2012,care dish worth arent homemad tofu tofu bo ssam special ssam gyup sal essenti tofu pork dish soup stew disappoint hae jang gook bore bulgogi stew sweet chap chae ridicul price charg beer order watch bill special stick kun jip qualiti homemad korean food,1,0.8316

Cho Dang Gol,5,"This has turned into my favorite Korean restaurant in town. I came here with coworkers, including 1 Korean. While we were seated, we were still waiting for my husband. I was worried they would rush us or wouldnt let us sit down unless the whole party has arrived. To my surprise, they were very patient and let us sit and wait while serving us side dishes. So we ended up ordering first anyway because they told us not to worry about waiting around. We ordered the tofu pots, bibimbop,seafood pancake and stir-fried octopus. The sides first of all, were very fresh and the refills keep coming without being asked. The kimchi tofu pot was amazing! It is even better than BCD in my opinion. The tofu tastes really natural and the broth isnt overly salty. I dont feel so bloated afterwards. The seafood pancake is a little soggy but the ingredients are again fresh and not greasy. The bibimbop on the other hand, is probably one of the best I have had too. It is a little pricy but it is so worth it! The only dish I didnt like as much is the spicy octopus. It felt like it was not cooked through completely. We had to send it back to get cooked again. But it came out much better the second time around. Overall, it was a great experience and surprisingly relaxing. I would definitely come here again.",2012,turn favorit korean restaur town cowork includ korean seat wait husband worri rush wouldnt sit parti arriv surpris patient sit wait serv side dish end order told worri wait order tofu pot bibimbop seafood pancak stir fri octopu side fresh refil come ask kimchi tofu pot amaz bcd opinion tofu tast natur broth isnt overli salti dont feel bloat seafood pancak soggi ingredi fresh greasi bibimbop hand prici worth dish didnt spici octopu felt cook complet send back cook time great experi surprisingli relax,1,0.9403
