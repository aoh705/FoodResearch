The food was delicious and very flavorful with a good amount of spice. When you order, you are able to choose the spice level from Mild all the way up to Thai Spicy (which I dont even dare to try, haha). Both the Thai Iced Tea and Lychee Thai Iced Tea were very good but a little too overly sweet for us, so we had to dilute it with a little bit of water.

(Details omitted) I asked if the mango juice was homemade and I was told yes by one waiter. When I asked for one without added sugar, the other waiter stuttered and confessed it comes from cans, like all their juices. Someone told has that their energy is now on the manhattan s place.

Well they re human too I understand, but if they all gonna eat together . It make more sense closing their doors for staff lunch time. Our waitress totally forgot my drink, and half of the food we order. She when back to her table to continue her lunch. We were so in shock  we couldn t believe that s was actually happening to us.

I think restaurants really need to do better on this. Can t imagine why a customer needs to pay extra gratuity for tax. Seating is a bit tight and the table we were at for 2 was by the entrance.

Getting the right spice balance with all the aromatic elements especially not ruining the coconut milk lightness and Thai basil is what I am happily pleased about. My wife had drunken noodles with salad and a roll; the drunken noodle were perfect and the peanut sauce on the salad was an exciting twist to a familiar flavor. We started with crab cakes which were a nice sized Ap. Then also got mussels which were delicious with there house made tangy zesty spicy green sauce. Thai iced coffees and lychee drink were huge for large which we also enjoyed. We over stuffed our selves with mango and sticky rice which also did not disappoint.

The menu at Ayada offers a delightful array of dishes, each packed with flavors that transport you to the streets of Thailand. Their mango salad is a true standout, with its delectable combination of sweetness and refreshing tanginess. For my family, the go-to choice is the flavorful drunken noodle, complemented by the option to have a perfectly cooked ribeye steak, tailored to your preference. One dish that consistently wows me is their tom yum soup, a fragrant and harmonious blend of spices and ingredients. However, my personal favorite is their green curry, bursting with rich and aromatic flavors. Dont worry about the heat level they accommodate your spice tolerance, ensuring a pleasant dining experience for all. If youre seeking an authentic taste of Thailand, Ayada is the place to be.

Ayada,5,"Hit up Ayada Thai in Elmhurst, Queens, NYC this weekend. Best Thom Ka chicken soup weve ever had in North America. Its like crack! Ordered the large and shared amongst the 4 of us. Also ordered the spring rolls, Drunken Noodles chicken and red curry chicken. Loved the first two. The red curry wasnt thick enough, and we didnt appreciate the flavor. Staff seated us right away and visited frequently to check on us. Had to prompt for water refills, though. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Food service time was perfect. They asked about spiciness level when ordering, and it was on the mark. My wife and I like it hot, but our guests dont. In terms of ambiance, its a cute place decorated Thai style. The bathroom is nice, but there is a single occupancy. Price is inexpensive for what you get in NYC.

Wife got the seafood mango salad, which is her favorite dish. I got the Crispy Duck Panang curry, which was recommended by the staff. The seafood mango salad dressing wasn t well balanced as it was too salty. You could hardly taste the mango at all, which is a huge disappointment because the main point of the dish is the fragrance, sweet and sour flavor, and crispy texture of unripe mango. Seafood wasn t fresh and they didn t cook them well enough, probably to try to get a certain chewy juicy texture. But I would say that was a bad move and I didn t really want to eat the seafood. The Crispy Duck Panang Curry was much worse.  First nothing about it was crispy.  The meat was too grainy. It s like the meat was old or wasn t stored properly and got bad before it was cooked. Or maybe they cooked it for too long. The texture of the rice was too soft and wet, melting in your mouth in a weird way. My first impression when I tasted the rice was that it was old and low quality. Pretty awful since rice doesnt come with the Duck Panang Curry and you have to pay for it separately. Additionally staff never checked up on us to ask if we needed anything else or whether everything was fine.

I showed The waiter how low the curry sauce was and asked can I get a little bit more to make it the normal serving size, and they said sure I will bring you extra sauce. I should have been cute on to the word extra as that is typically when restaurants see an opportunity to charge you for something which you dont realize is being charged until you get the bill. lol Thats exactly what happened here they brought a bowl of sauce which was much more than I needed and then there was a $4 up charge on the bill at the end. This totally ruined the meal for me considering the dish was low on curry sauce from the get-go. I was with other people so didnt make a scene so this review is my protest. I feel bad giving this low review because again the food was decent and the curry sauce excellent (creamy and flavorful). but then again what good is excellent curry sauce if they dont give you enough to finish the dish with rice? hopefully this review helps improve their consistency and customer service attitude. Maybe I will try again in the future and if I have a better experience well give a much higher review.",2022,good curri disappoint servic consist order curri dish panang massaman chicken curri chicken averag curri base excel problem musselman carri good amount curri base reason panang liter half curri liquid eat bowl rice show waiter low curri sauc ask bit make normal serv size bring extra sauc cute word extra typic restaur opportun charg dont realiz charg bill lol happen brought bowl sauc need charg bill end total ruin meal dish low curri sauc peopl didnt make scene review protest feel bad give low review food decent curri sauc excel creami flavor good excel curri sauc dont give finish dish rice review help improv consist custom servic attitud futur experi give higher review,-1,0.7351

Location: It is located in Woodside, Queens. The restaurant is a little bit small but with seatings indoor and outdoor. The interior is okay, you will came here for the food and not for the ambience. lol Service: The servers are nice, they gave you good recommendations even though I know what I am going to get. Food: All that we ordered was delicious, they had big servings as well so we couldnt finish it even though it was so good. DUCK PANANG CURRY: this is a must! The duck was fried or roasted then they add the panang curry on it. OMG the best thai food I ate! FRIED FISH with MANGO SALAD: what a good pairing! The mango compliments the fried fish! Fish is huge and taste fresh. CHINESE BROCCOLI with CRISPY PORK: the broccoli was cooked perfectly. I like it when it is medium cooked, crunchy. CALAMARI: it is fried and not crunchy which I liked cause I want the squid to be still soft. PAD THAI: it was delicious, the noodles were cooked al dente, and I usually get it with PORK. THAI ICED TEA: it was not that sweet and silky smooth drink, I hope there is boba on it tho. LOL. Price rating: 6/10, cheap! I thought it will be expensive but the price is not bad.

The soft shell itself had to much oil from the frier though. My favorite dish was the curry duck, although a sweet coconut flavor came through a little too much. Ended with the mango sticky rice, which was good on the very sweet mango side and just ok on the rice. Beer wasn t cold. White wine was colder and an easier drink.

The mussels were delicious and the esarn was awesome. Then we went on to fried red snapper with a papaya salad and the famous duck in red curry sauce. Both were excellent and left us feeling stuffed.

Ayada,5,"As good as it gets  . Ayada Thai was on my sights for a while, Michelin crowned, interesting, authentic, and the New York Times s  Absolute Best Thai Food in Elmhurst . But it s in Queens, I don t go to Queens   Since it was a short working day today and I already had the car out, I decided to brave it.  Turned out that Elmhurst QNS is  the nexus of New York s Thai community. To my surprise it even had parking.  . At the street corner of Ayada there were at least 4 more thai restaurants.  I was in Thai heaven.  As a warm up, following the reviews, I ordered the Raw Shrimp Salad.  It came with some hot concoction on top of each of these raw crustaceans, and if it wasn t hot enough, a raw halved garlic clove was placed on each.  The Papaya salad with seafood was next.  That was an absolute explosion of flavors.  Sending varied flavor particles everywhere in my mouth.  At the end, I found myself gorging on these flavors with a table spoon hunting it s last drops.  While I really couldn t eat much more,  I had to try a curry dish.  Surprisingly, I chose the green curry and since  variety is the spice of life . I surprised myself and ordered the duck this time  . This place was definitely Thailicious.  So who have won  the Best Thai Award  so far?  Well, as my daughters like to say, they all won    . I definitely did by having these little jewels of Thai heaven  . .",2022,good ayada thai sight michelin crown interest authent york time absolut thai food elmhurst queen don queen short work day today car decid brave turn elmhurst qn nexu york thai commun surpris park street corner ayada thai restaur thai heaven warm review order raw shrimp salad hot concoct top raw crustacean wasn hot raw halv garlic clove papaya salad seafood absolut explos flavor send vari flavor particl mouth end found gorg flavor tabl spoon hunt drop couldn eat curri dish surprisingli chose green curri varieti spice life surpris order duck time place thailici won thai award daughter won jewel thai heaven,1,0.9833

A different waiter came out and my husband complained to him that I never got my food but then just asked for the check. The gentleman apologized and brought out my dish and said  we apologize, it s complimentary.  Since everyone had finished eating, I asked them to have the dish packed. Another waiter came out to say sorry that wasn t yours so we can t give that to you. God knows, if someone else is eating the dish they put in front of me.

We never encountered this sort of heinous customer service in our life. I ordered a rib eye drunkin- medium well. I was served rare and when I wanted to return it back the server is saying thats medium well when it clearly wasnt because of the blood coming out and the inside was pink.

Ayada,3,"I m writing this review on behalf of my fiance. Here and I have been here several times for lunch, always a great meal at a reasonable price. She, like many others in the lunchtime crowd here, work at the local hospital. The other day she went for lunch by herself.  Her meal was great as usual.  The bill came, for a total of $13.95.  Great lunch specials. Not having any cash on her, she went to pay by credit card.   The server informed her that she couldn t use her credit card unless it was for a certain minimum charge.  She was also told by the server that there was an ATM next door. This isn t good business for several reasons. The first reason, it s illegal to refuse a credit card for any amount.  A business can say that you must have a minimum charge ( the law is $10) to use a card without incurring a fee.   But a business cannot refuse a card. My fiance, not wanting to be confrontational being that she is a regular customer here, went to the ATM.  It is one of those out in the street bodega ATMs that charge the cardholder a fee to make a withdrawal. I m not saying she or I will never go here again.  The food is great, prices reasonable, service always friendly. Maybe the server was new and not aware of the ways credit card laws work. But any charge over $10 should have been accepted by credit card payment by any business. In this day and age more people use charge cards than cash. Hopefully this can be addressed for the best interest of this great business and its  regular customers.",2020,write review behalf fianc time lunch great meal reason price lunchtim crowd work local hospit day lunch meal great usual bill total great lunch special cash pay credit card server inform couldn credit card minimum charg told server atm door isn good busi reason reason illeg refus credit card amount busi minimum charg law card incur fee busi refus card fianc want confront regular custom atm street bodega atm charg cardhold fee make withdraw food great price reason servic friendli server awar way credit card law work charg accept credit card payment busi day age peopl charg card cash address interest great busi regular custom,0,0.9917

I stopped in for a classic pad thai lunch special, which also came with choice of soup (which i chose) or salad, and a spring roll.  I also ordered some fried chicken wings that came with sweet chili sauce for dipping. I would say the pad thai was good, but not fantastic.  Noodles were good, but pad thai is a delicate balance of sweet, salty, and sour, but the pad thai I had seemed to be a little light on the salty and heavier on the sweet, with a hint of sour.  Perhaps it was an off time?  Not sure, but I was definitely expecting a higher standard considering its Elmhurst and theres Thai food everywhere. The chicken wings were very crispy and cooked well.  The sauce was a typical thai sweet chili, so I had no complaints there. Overall, Ayada seems like a solid thai option and I would come back again to try their other dishes.  Id give them a 3.5 but rounded up to a 4 cause there really wasnt anything bad.

Firstly, the restaurant is split into two (Im guessing both sides are open during rush hours) and on the half that we were seated in, we were comfortable. The seats arent that close and there is enough room to squeeze between tables and sit on the other side of the table. Its a very cozy place and the food is absolutely amazing. I tried the Thai Iced Tea - a little on the sweeter side but nonetheless refreshing. Their menu is extensive and inexpensive so your party can go ahead and order a few things to share. They also list the spice level (and ask you) so you can adjust it to you taste. Only downside is that they only accept a max of two cards to pay - not a deal breaker but can be a bit inconvenient if youre going with a large party of friends.",2019,amaz read review place small bit worri seat situat pleasantli surpris firstli restaur split im guess side open rush hour half seat comfort seat arent close room squeez tabl sit side tabl cozi place food absolut amaz thai ice tea sweeter side nonetheless refresh menu extens inexpens parti ahead order thing share list spice level adjust tast downsid accept max card pay deal breaker bit inconveni your larg parti friend,1,0.8442

Thai food is supposed to be spicy so obviously went with the level above normal/mild. Was great as it reminded me of the food I had in Thailand. Papaya salad with crab is very good. So are the Pad Thai Pork and Panang Curry Pork. Beef is not their natural meat in Thailand, so I prefer Pork and it goes very well with their style of cooking. Tried their cocktails - were different and nice. The portions are good. Reasonably priced for very good quality food.

My girlfriend was so incensed by the owners behavior that she was on the verge of throwing a glass of water at him.

We were not even provided with any of the sides for the ordered food and you need to ask them. You will be treated well if you are ordering more. One of the customers near our table were questioned whether they are going to order anymore, when they said NO immediately the person who served brought the cheque to them. You will be treated well until you make the cheque. They will always be ready to keep you out for which they stay near you and once you are in they look at you whether if you are there ordered already and then only you will be served with water. We explored many foods in New York and this is one of the worst experiences we had. The other shops we explored in Chelsea Market didn t have the mandatory tip though their services were too good. But here you will be treated good or bad based on the food you order which was totally disappointing. The customers next to our table have ordered less and seeing their experience we didn t have the thought of ordering any more.

I ve had the massaman curry (average taste but very aesthetic) and summer rolls (bland but works well with the creamy sauce) that I enjoyed over a nice classy ambiance. Yesterday I drove 1.5 hours with special friends to give them the experience I enjoy. I really hyped it up, we were hungry and looking forward to it. Online it says they close after 9 but when I got there around 3:30, the moment we stepped inside they shooed us away saying they re closed and to visit their smaller restaurant in Chelsea market. Well we go sit there (less aesthetic, loud disco music) and I try ordering my tried and tested items. Well despite it being summer in June, they didn t have summer rolls. Everyone s majorly disappointed at this second setback but they figure since we re here let s just order something. So we order the massaman curry. You ll see an image attached with the floral vegetables of what I ve always had, comes with a pita bread ($36~). And then you ll see an image of what they served us yesterday. Completely different look, taste and presentation. Came with rice instead of bread. The menu was the same, item was the same so I ordered the same thing. When I show the server my picture and ask, they explain that original menu item was discontinued and they serve this knockoff instead. How misleading!! The menu should ve been updated, there should ve been signage somewhere to indicate items may differ but no nothing! And this dish was $18! Incredibly overpriced for what it is, didn t taste good. Despite my negative experience, they offered nothing, no apologies or anything to compensate for my waste of time and horrible experience. I was so embarrassed in front of my friends.

The coconut ice cream had that heavenly aftertaste of coconut, the custard was more spongy than silky but perhaps that was how it was intended.

We were greeted by a fantastic bar tender and a lovely cocktail menu. The bartender told us it was happy hour from 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm and the cocktails were $12. A very reasonable specialty cocktail price in NYC. I started with the Conga and Kiss From A Rose. The best cocktails we had during our week in NYC and probably the best cocktails I ve ever had. Our call for Oyster happy hour came quickly so we didn t get to enjoy our cocktails as long as we anticipated so we told the bartender we would be back for another after oysters. Now go get this. We eat Oysters and I go to get my wallet to pay and it s gone. Of course my heart and stomach just sink. I must have left it on the bar at Ayada. It s long gone I m sure and now I m screwed. I run over and am quickly greeted by their team and presented with my wallet. They totally saved the day!! We came back and ordered two more cocktails, the green papaya salad, spring rolls, and two shots of tequila to calm our nerves. The Conga ended up being our favorite cocktail and the green papaya salad was the best we have ever had and we order it all the time. It s extremely flavorful and spicy!

I am a Food and Beverage veteran from major Forbes 4 and 5 star operations. What I experienced was horrific and unprecedented. The server began flirting with my companion to the point my experience was ruined as he obtained her phone number, and then tried to woo her with a free soft drink, disregarding that I had brought her there for dinner, and he had zero idea as he approached the table if we were companions or a couple Ultimately,  this resulted in losing my friend over the incident.

As much as I wanted to love this place, the service wasn t that great. We were standing in front of the store to get seated only for a waiter to come over to us & pointed two empty seats to sit & not using his words. For the first 10 mins of our service, the waiter just used hand gestures or eye contact to  communicate  us. I just thought it was really rude. He didn t check up on us either. When we were about to pay, it totaled 69.70  dollars so I paid 70 dollars in cash, while I was trying to find a hundred dollar to ask them for a change. He came over to us and asked us  was the tip included?  I understand it might seem like I wasn t tipping but I was going to. (I worked in the restaurant industry for years before college so I already understood how the tipping is really beneficial for restaurant workers.) but that was the only time I ve heard him spoken in full sentence. That made me wondered how can he expect a good tip with a bad service. I usually tip servers 20% or even more because I empathize with them but this time, I couldn t help but tipped him 15% only. Bad service really minuses out the entire eating experience.

Our water was always filled, the manager was always on the floor checking on customers and even bringing them food and our waiter was so kind and gave us everything we wanted. His recommendation for Leo thai beers were a slam dunk. They were light and refreshing with chilled glasses. The chicken dumplings came in 4 and definitely held me over until main course, I appreciate how they took out the shrimp for me. The beef curry dish was spicy but phenomenal, the flavors and seasoning all complement one another and portion is perfect! I loved my basil fried rice with meat of choice , chicken was chopped finely and it was also mega spicy as I wanted but was not over the top and it had so much great seasoning . All of this for 60 dollars was well spent and a memorable experience. I also appreciate the beautiful decor from statutes to fine china and beautiful outdoor seating too with flowers and private booths.

Ayada,5,Good Thai spot. You cant go wrong with familiar options like the pad thai or pad se ew. The pork and broccoli is also a good recommendation along with any of the spring rolls. The wait times seemed pretty quick. Id definitely wait 10-20 minutes if youre in the mood for some Thai food.,2020,good thai spot wrong familiar option pad thai pad se ew pork broccoli good recommend spring roll wait time pretti quick id wait minut your mood thai food,1,0.6369

Ayada,1,"I liked Ayada in Queens, and was looking forward with great excitement the opining of the Manhattan location. I have to say, Im super disappointed. First of all, the menu is much smaller at the Manhattan location, leaving of some of the more interesting dishes. The new locations menu is a typical, commonplace Thai menu. The food isnt bad everything tastes fresh and is well prepared but its not as good as the Queens location. When Ive ordered take-out, Ive noticed that the staff has a very consistent, deliberate and somewhat scamming way of encouraging you, with a slight but noticable bit of pressure, to click on the 20%   26% tip buttons on their credit card reader, always with the directive, Click below and then click enter.  The fourth or fifth option is Custom amount. Their pressuring approach and omission of all the options in their verbal instructions, makes it feel as if they want you to click 26% before you realize that there are other options. They also hover over you, watching to see what youre clicking.  They make it feel as though they are trying to give you the impression that it is commonplace to give a 26% tip for take-out. Nuts! Also, their suggested tips are based on a post tax total. Shady! If you think Im playing too much into this, I suggest the reader read on to some of the other poor reviews to read about this restaurants suggested tip policy for dine-in. They seem to have some shady policies. Thirdly, Ive worked in restaurants before, so I understand that there is a strong desire on the part of both management and wait staff to turn over tables, but one of the things that one learns as a waiter is that people dine out partly to enjoy a night out with friends, chatting, enjoying each others complany, and that its totally inappropriate and terrible restaurant etiquette to ask your customers to leave because you need the table (especially when the restaurant isnt that crowded). The staff at Ayada probably care less about their customers because management thinks that that most of their customers are tourists and will probably never come back anyway. Well, neither will this local.",2020,ayada queen forward great excit opin manhattan locat im super disappoint menu smaller manhattan locat leav interest dish locat menu typic commonplac thai menu food isnt bad tast fresh prepar good queen locat ive order ive notic staff consist deliber scam encourag slight notic bit pressur click tip button credit card reader direct click click enter fourth option custom amount pressur approach omiss option verbal instruct make feel click realiz option hover watch your click make feel give impress commonplac give tip nut suggest tip base post tax total shadi im play suggest reader read poor review read restaur suggest tip polici dine shadi polici thirdli ive work restaur understand strong desir part manag wait staff turn tabl thing learn waiter peopl dine partli enjoy night friend chat enjoy complani total inappropri terribl restaur etiquett custom leav tabl restaur isnt crowd staff ayada care custom manag think custom tourist back local,-1,0.9823

Ayada,1,"In reply to Patrick: I was also there with my mom only. 2 people. The problem is how you just sneakily put that 18% (in my case 26%) on top of suggested tips and didnt even tell me. I wouldnt have realized if my card just had a problem and I just happened to notice the new total on the bill. TRYING TO SCAM TOURISTS is WRONG. Be careful, this placed decide on the tip amount themselves and hide it from you! And in my case, they put 26% tips on the bill without telling me and they also tried to hide it by showing us a bill that was $68 plus tax at first. Then luckily, their pin pad didnt work and the guy asked me to try another credit card. Thats when I found out my bill became $68 + $18 service charge + tax. Never had I once experienced that the restaurant would decide on how much should the customers tip them. When I confronted them, they told me it was their standard practice and the service charge meant tips. My experience dining here was not satisfying at all. Oh and one more thing, the guy that worked there was very pushy. He would keep trying to get you to order the most expensive dishes, and also upgrade your dish without telling you the cost.

Ayada,4,"We like the original location in Queens so much that we decided to come to this nearer new location for a try(Its located on the second floor in Chelsea market). The options are limited compared with the Queens one, but food and service was not bad. Also price is higher considering its in Manhattan (about 50% higher). Please note they charge $2/4/6 extra for the protein added to your dish, and a mandatory 18% tips (I saw other reviewers say they were charged 26% tips so I guess they lowered it due to customer complaints).",2020,origin locat queen decid nearer locat locat floor chelsea market option limit compar queen food servic bad price higher manhattan higher note charg extra protein ad dish mandatori tip review charg tip guess lower due custom complaint,1,-0.7845
