Atoboy,4,"The dining experience as a whole was satisfactory; certain dishes stood out while others fell short of expectations. The entrees, particularly the fried chicken, failed to leave a lasting impression, especially when contrasted with the myriad of exceptional Korean fried chicken offerings available in NYC. The cod was one-note with an overpowering gochugang curry sauce. There were notable highlights such as the sea urchin steamed egg, the squash, and the refreshing sujeonggwa granita, though the occasional overpowering presence of cinnamon in the granita detracted slightly from the overall enjoyment. I would recommend a visit to sample select items, but skip the fried chicken and cod.",2024,dine experi satisfactori dish stood fell short expect entre fri chicken fail leav last impress contrast myriad except korean fri chicken offer nyc cod note overpow gochugang curri sauc notabl highlight sea urchin steam egg squash refresh sujeonggwa granita occasion overpow presenc cinnamon granita detract slightli enjoy recommend visit sampl select item skip fri chicken cod,1,0.7579

Atoboy,3,"My friend and I decided on Atoboy as the main food-event for our NYC trip. We were very much looking forward to this place we had heard great things about, luckily the food did not dissapoint. Unfortunately the dining experience was overshadowed by the rushed feeling of the evening. None of the courses had a minute between them. The mains were served almost immediately after the add-on fried chicken course (+28$), promised between the 2nd and 3rd course; by the time we had finished it, our mains had already gotten cold. The wine service was great and sommelier knowledgeable but same as the food, we could not finish a glass before getting a refill. While finishing our wine, our conversation was disrupted by the waitress smacking the bill (that we hadn t yet asked for) on our table wishing us a  good night  without any inquiry on how our night had gone. While less expensive than it s older sibling Atomix, a ~300$ would still warrant a relaxing dining experience, which the 1,5hr reservation simply does not provide.",2024,friend decid atoboy main food event nyc trip forward place heard great thing luckili food dissapoint dine experi overshadow rush feel even cours minut main serv immedi add fri chicken promis time finish main cold wine servic great sommeli knowledg food finish glass refil finish wine convers disrupt waitress smack bill hadn ask tabl wish good night inquiri night expens older sibl atomix warrant relax dine experi hr reserv simpli provid,0,0.9633

But it was disappointing, the amuse bouche with sea urchin was downright bland and therefore a mediocre start to the menu. The subsequent dishes were all very small but mainly flat and tasteless. A dish with morels was simply watery and the morel had little to no taste. My main course of vakrkens jaw (you read that right) was the worst dish I ever received in a fine dining restaurant. Price-quality is really not right here. I also ordered 2 glasses of white wine and they were glasses instead of glasses. Sorry, this is the biggest disappointment of 2023 for me.

The two sauces accompanying the chicken could have had more flavor and depth in my opinion but chicken itself was done quite well. The rice and banchan that came out at the end were also quite disappointing - we expected more flavor from the rice and also felt like the texture was off given large chunks were sticking together.

But then, I really shouldnt be surprised as Atoboy is a sister restaurant of famed Atomix. Now something that could maybe be fixed, which is the acoustic of the restaurant. I see there are sound dampening panels on the walls already, but maybe it can also be added to the ceilings as well?? But this shouldnt take away from visiting the restaurant. Another thing that Ive noticed is that the restrooms are downstairs, and I dont see any assisted equipment for anyone with mobility issues, so that can be a challenging thing.

Atoboy,5,"Tartlets - Soft, crispy tartlet carefully caresses a rich, aromatic, and slightly sour seasonal summer squash-ricotta mousse. Yukpo, or Korean beef jerky is sprinkled on top for that delightful smokiness and umami. Fluke with Strawberry and Sangria sauce - were lucky to be gifted this dish of raw fluke. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the lean, flaky texture of the fluke. The slight chewiness helps you appreciate the sweetness of the strawberries, the fragrance of the shiso, and the tanginess of the seafood soup. XO Scallops with Orange Slices - an upgrade over the regular menu features the freshest scallops, swimming in a pool of umami, the crunchy fragrance of the xo sauce, paired with a perfectly tart slice of orange and breadcrumbs to create a melody of all the pleasant flavors that you can imagine in your mouth. Broccolini with Creme Fraiche, Pine Nuts. - Broccolini and garlic scapes infused with a delicious buttery flavour are a great way to eat your veggies, especially if you provide a simple yet tasty addition of pine nuts, and a generous portion of creme fraiche to layer on that indulgence Prawn Mandu with Corn and Creamy Lobster Soup. - What lies underneath a delicately thin layer of crisp, is a juicy and crispy bite of mashed shrimp. Once you bite down, an explosion of fresh shrimp flavour breaks out, as the creaminess of the foie gras and lobster broth caresses your tongue. Fried Chicken with Peanut Sauce and Gochujang - The definition of a delicately fried, JUICY pieces of chicken. Something so good its worth burning your mouth for. Past that crispy, golden veil is a mouth-watering, moist piece of chicken that shows its full potential when dipped in a tangy gochujang sauce or a fragrant, nutty peanut sauce that I will admit, is lacking in abundance because I loved it so much Pork Belly with Potato Puree and Enoki Mushrooms - fatty pieces of roasted pork belly thats tender and pairs well with the rice. The potato puree tasted like potato but also a like sour and cheesy. Also came with some fresh herb. Steamed Halibut in Sweet Halibut Soup and Congee - This halibut is cooked wonderfully, flaky, sound and fall apart in your mouth, served with a sweet, umami soup based on the natural flavours of the fish, and garnished with chives for that extra fragrance. I also typically dont like congee. Chocolate Mousse - A deep, rich and smooth chocolate outer layer encompasses a smooth but marshmallow-y texture from the ingenious rice cakes that are incorporated into the mousse on the inside. The result is a decadent, chocolatey goodness that melts in your mouth, topped with a cocoa crumble to add that extra tickle of chocolate in your nose. Granita - the only complaint is the portion size here. This cinnamon based granita is a first experience for me, a literal melt-in-your-mouth texture with a pleasant spice from the cinnamon, paired with a perfectly not-to-sweet lychee yoghurt which is smooth as butter, and a layer of burrata to add that extra creaminess.

Also very aggressive upselling at every corner of the menu, e.g., 18 dollars extra to switch the main from pork to octopus. Nice try. We sat towards the back, and its just a very unpleasant atmosphere, as there is a constant stream of rushed waiters running by (the restaurant is a long tunnel, so there is no other way to get service done of course). Service has to be quick, we get it, but its just a lot and we felt rushed the whole time (also we never knew if we had a dedicated waiter or not, and everybody was referring to someone else sadly). Probably avoid the Naegroni, its a sweetly fused something that has nothing to do with a Negroni, taste-wise. Maybe thats the idea, but it wasnt for me.

We wondered whether this was the reason behind dishes that were knock out winners and some dishes that were misses. The first three dishes - uni, yellowtail, beef tartare and scallop were outstanding. Delicately crafted and delivered. What followed were more unsubtle dishes - the octopus and ribs. The octopus was cooked well, but tried to reenact the classic Spanish dish of potatoes and tomato sauce with a Korean twist. It didn t work and was lackadaisical in its delivery. Then came the ribs - dry and overpowered by a chimmichurri that did not work at all in harmony with the glaze. Overall flourishes of brilliance entwined with disappoint.

One course was called shrimp Mandu with foie Gras, corn and lobster broth. The composition sounded interesting but was not well executed. Too many ingredients that overpowered each other which resulted in not being able to taste anything but the shrimp. If I hadn t known I wouldn t have noticed the foie gras at all. What I also noticed was the food came out extremely fast. If you hadn t  finished a course yet, the next one was still placed on your table nevertheless. It was not at all pleasant to feel rushed while trying to enjoy each course. Besides bringing out the food way too fast, sometimes it was even served and the empty dishes did not get cleared. Very strange service. The pork belly dish was yet another disappointment. Mine was too dry, my friends pork belly was only fat. The dish and composition itself was boring and did not have the flavor I would have wished for. Desert was good but still not a single dish was really standing out to me. One last thing I found disappointing was, that there is no a la carte option. I find, it should at least be an option for when you are not as hungry but would still like to try out things. I don t think I will be back, there are so many other great Korean places in this city, you should not waste so much money at this place.",2023,read atoboy excit final relat great review read call shrimp mandu foie gra corn lobster broth composit sound interest execut ingredi overpow result tast shrimp hadn wouldn notic foie gra notic food extrem fast hadn finish tabl pleasant feel rush enjoy bring food fast serv empti dish clear strang servic pork belli dish disappoint mine dri friend pork belli fat dish composit bore flavor wish desert good singl dish stand thing found disappoint la cart option find option hungri thing don back great korean place citi wast money place,-1,0.9709

Everything was tasty and delicious! We absolutely loved the sea urchin and egg jjim starter, the yellowtail crudo with jellyfish salad (such a flavour bomb, I will think about this dish for a long time it was so good!).

Atoboy,1,"FOUND A SHARP SHARD OF GLASS in my second course big enough to cause serious damage. They replaced it with another dish not included in the prix fixe price that I did not want or even ask for. They did this without asking me if I even wanted it first. I stayed for the rest of the meal so as not to cause a scene. The supplemental price of that single unwanted replacement dish was deducted from my bill,  about $20. I had to pay for everything else as usual, including the full prix fixe price (included the original second course). I count myself extremely lucky that I found the glass before putting it in my mouth. But the way this was handled by the restaurant was simply insulting after literally endangering someone s well-being. Ridiculous.

Yes you can come in and out for $75 a person, but once you add some drinks, it can add up. Note: their bar is limited but their Makgeolli selection (when available) is very good. Before we get to the food, the service here was absolutely amazing. It s a casual environment but everyone works so hard to make sure your glasses are full, your napkins are available because we can be messy eaters, and they make sure we have clean plates for every course. Now, I don t have a massive appetite so the regular set menu and drinks was more than enough to keep me full. I notice a lot of people order the chicken wings, which come with 4 pieces, but that would have been too much for us. The urchin dish to start was delicious, I m not a big urchin fan, but this was so good. Everything on the set menu was so good, my favourite is the duck, it had a crispy skin and some contrasting balancing flavours. They also include a couple of kimchi style sides (apple and cucumber) as well as a bowl of sweet potato rice. Do yourself a favour and try this place out when you get a chance.

Flavor wise it delivered, but it was extremely tough and could not bite into it. Given the size of each piece and the tough/chewy texture, it was hard to eat.

Atoboy,1,"Last month, I went to eat at Atoboy and felt like it was underwhelming and overhyped. For somewhere that was $75pp before add-ons, we got a bowl of shaved ice that had a SHARP HARD PIECE OF PLASTIC (pictured) inside of the dish that I had almost swallowed. When we showed the waitress, all we received was an apology and no other form of compensation. This piece of plastic was hard and sharp, almost like a broken piece of glass. Not to mention, the portions were way too small even for someone petite like me. My friend has a shellfish allergy and majority of the menu at the time was unable to accommodate. Furthermore, on the website, the menu included the Uni Bowl which was the whole reason why I wanted to give Atoboy a try. However, when we showed up, we were told that there was no Uni and that there would be a crab dish instead with an add-on price the same as the Uni dish. The service was underwhelming as I felt like the wait staffs did not present themselves professionally and did not seem as if they were familiar with their job. They were unable to give recommendations to dishes that would be safe to my friend s allergies. After discovering the dangerous sharp piece of plastic in my dessert, the only response we received was  we are so sorry . The piece of plastic was in the shaved ice and I had almost swallowed it. The only good dishes were the fried chicken and scallop which you needed to add-on an additional $28 and $12. Overall my friends and I were very disappointed in Atoboy as for meal which costed over $100pp in the end after add-ons and tax, it was not worth the price, judging on food alone. As for the sharp piece of plastic found in my shaved ice, I expected a much more attentive apology or form of compensation from a high tier restaurant like Atoboy as this was extremely unprofessional and unacceptable.",2023,month eat atoboy felt underwhelm overhyp pp add on bowl shave ice sharp hard piec plastic pictur insid dish swallow show waitress receiv apolog form compens piec plastic hard sharp broken piec glass mention portion small petit friend shellfish allergi major menu time unabl accommod websit menu includ uni bowl reason want give atoboy show told uni crab dish add price uni dish servic underwhelm felt wait staff present profession familiar job unabl give recommend dish safe friend allergi discov danger sharp piec plastic dessert respons receiv piec plastic shave ice swallow good dish fri chicken scallop need add addit friend disappoint atoboy meal cost pp end add on tax worth price judg food sharp piec plastic found shave ice expect attent apolog form compens high tier restaur atoboy extrem unprofession unaccept,-1,0.8442

Atoboy,5,"The exceptional modern Korean course, yet casual and chill atmosphere. On little quiet block of the 28th street, the modern concrete wall with subtle wooden door was the sign to Atoboy. Unlike its secretive and little upscale look from its outside, the inside looked like a comforting Asian diners, but ones in a movie with its minimal interior style and the lighting. The first thing that I loved about Atoboy was their Fried Chicken that you could add-on to your course. As a parent, I usually share course meals with my daughter as she wouldnt eat the most. I thought it was a smart idea to have Fried Chickens as add-on, then children could have smaller meals and their parents could also try for ourselves without overwhelming us. Their Fried Chickens were served with spicy peanut sauce and gochujang sauce, which were phenomenal together. A few other families seemed to do the same thing. The course was amazing and it packed a lot about Atoboy. Their Fried Chickens could easily steal everyones favorite votes with their flashy look and volume; In contrast, each dish in their course made me want to spend time quietly and digest each bite. Although entrees we had (Pork Belly and Cod) were good, I might pick Beet (smoked yogurt, strawberry chojang, and miyeok) for my most memorable dish for its uniqueness. Unlike other places, I would not worry about finishing their course as their portions were perfect. The course was $75 with hospitality fee included, which seemed amazing in the city.

Atoboy,4,"Cute, modern Korean prix fixe menu (gratuity included) for $75. I thought the dishes were well presented, but nothing out of this world for me. Portions are also small but satisfying imo. You can get KFC and other protein add ons if you desire something more filling. First course: summer squash tartlette with yukpo (dried beef floss). This tasted very rich, kind of like a squash soup on a tart. The dried meat didnt really shine through, felt like something citrus-y would have been interesting. Second: Fluke mulhwe. The fluke was quite cold / frozen, indicating the fish was not freshly cut. I think the dish would be stronger if the texture of a fresh fish or well defrosted one paired with the astringent chilli cold soup. Third: shrimp mandoo. Tasty filling, deep fry was nice touch, I would have expected steamed. The sweetness from the corn underneath paired well with the lobster broth. Fourth: halibut juk. My asian comfort food, so was excited for this one. The halibut was a bit overcooked, but the broth softened the bite. Paired with an umami seaweed seasoned rice, banchan (bell peppers) and cucumber kimchi. I thought the banchan and kimchi were alright, Ive had better. Fifth: Dessert granita. A cinammon bingsoo and lychee yogurt combo with walnuts. Very refreshing, and cold. I can see how the cinammon was combined to bring warmth, but I felt like the yogurt could have been a bit less chilled or whipped to give a better texture.

Atoboy,2,"What a weird place. We have received very mixed feelings. The prefix was good. We cannot say amazing or outstanding, but it was just good. The first course is not actually a course, in other restaurants they call it a small treat from a chef. The second course - order scallops, they are amazing (fluke is nothing special, chrysanthemum salad is just okay); the third course I took sea urchin, it was good, but not so good for extra $27, it was too much tofu and so little sea urchin . Third course was tasty, but the lamb was over cooked, halibut is only good if you like it. Best thing ever was a bucket with chicken! And we expected korean kimchi, but it was kimchi made of broccolini stems. And omg, desert!!!!  Sorry, but it was VERY BAD. Guys, trust me, order a rice cake & do not go for that tempting lychee something. Jeeez that lychee+burata: ewwwwwww! I do not want to use strong words here , but ewwww! All plates with this desert are unfinished or even untouched (we paid attention when we were leaving). I think that should be a red flag for the chef. Service was really good. Nothing to say about that. The restaurant, the way it looks, is extremely cheap, plastic chairs, naked walls, holes in the walls, cheap cutlery (they do not change it through the courses), only tissue napkins are provided, nothing to put on your knees. The place has a very uncomfortable light. You expect something more intimate, but with this light you feel like you are eating in a surgical room. The other big issue is the space is super noisy, we heard everyones conversation, that was a bit disturbing. And of course, the check was giant. For 4 people it was $800 + tips. We ordered two bottles of wine, which was $200 total. Counting without wine it was still a pretty significant check for this place. When I pay that money, I do not expect to see people in joggers/sportswear or/and with their laptop with legs up on the chair & headphones working.

That s what I felt from the foods here. The people are very friendly, the restaurant is neatly decorated, and the food is delicious, so I think its a 5-star restaurant, but I think its better not to go there expecting it to be a Korean restaurant. My impression was that it was a sophisticated, decent restaurant that mixed some Korean flavors into some of its menu items. Some of the memorable menus were - Appetizer that had tofu ricotta on it. I don t enjoy creamy stuff that often but the tofu riccotta was so my taste, very creamy but not heavy at all. - Fried chicken that I didn t have high expectations, but the batter is so thin and crispy so it tasted surprisingly different than usual Korean style fried chicken from Manhattan - Granita was amazing and this is probably the best menu from here in regards to making a menu that feels very Korean cuisine but not exactly traditional Korean style.

The  mains  (4th course) were a mixed bag. I got to eat the pork belly-delicious but a small portion-and the lamb which was tough, fatty, tiny, and not worth the $10 up charge at all. The fried chicken was great, but not better than other Korean fried chicken options in the area and at $27, it is extremely expensive for what is essentially six chicken nuggets. Both dessert options were great. Probably the most interesting part of the meal. Overall, for the cost I think there are many better options in the city. I was disappointed to see repeated ingredients across the 5 courses, especially when the menu is so small and tight. Service was top notch.

It was a particularity windy night, and we had to resort to putting on our coats all throughout dinner. The pre-set five course meal was mediocre. The most memorable was the first dish (and not for the right reasons): an oyster set on a corn cake topped with some greens. It was hard to swallow - the oyster s gaminess overpowered the whole dish. Wish there were some acidic elements to balance out the dish. Favorites were the two desserts, they were fantastic. Other than that, I had a beer - a Pilsner, and it was 16 dollars.

Atoboy,5,"An innovative Korean restaurant with thoughtful surprises in every dish. Each course in the pre-fixe menu was all agreeable and masterful. The wagyu yukhye was fantastic - the beef was playfully chewy and had a tingle in spice. The yuzu was very subtle and enjoyable. On the other hand, the yellowtail was also excellent. It comes with potato strands for crunch, and a broccoli rabe for an unexpected bitterness. For the next course, the beet was a thick cut that was thus the dominant flavor. The contrast from the intensely sour finger lime was very enjoyable. The octopus had a delightful first bite: the sweet potato paste was an interesting combination. The highlight of the meal are the sunchokes, an original item from the restaurant s earlier years. It s an explosion of flavors with the truffle cream truly popping out. The sweet dashi and mushrooms are great together, while the orange is like a chaos factor. The deep fried cod comes in a fruity yet curried sauce. It has small chunks of fruits, while the chevre cheese adds a wonderful gaminess. It went well with rice. The pork belly was ok; it could ve been softer and didn t have any flavor by itself. The sauce was alright, but the sunchoke chips were nice. Desserts were excellent. The granita is impressively unique: elements of many different desserts you don t associate together come together - cinnamon, burrata, pecan, lychee. It was notably salted. The burnt cheesecake had a thorough smokey flavor. The caramel drizzle was lovely and it was dissonantly topped with fresh fruits.",2022,innov korean restaur thought surpris dish pre fix menu agreeabl master wagyu yukhy fantast beef play chewi tingl spice yuzu subtl enjoy hand yellowtail excel potato strand crunch broccoli rabe unexpect bitter beet thick cut domin flavor contrast intens sour finger lime enjoy octopu delight bite sweet potato past interest combin highlight meal sunchok origin item restaur earlier year explos flavor truffl cream pop sweet dashi mushroom great orang chao factor deep fri cod fruiti curri sauc small chunk fruit chevr chees add wonder gami rice pork belli ve softer didn flavor sauc alright sunchok chip nice dessert excel granita impress uniqu element dessert don associ cinnamon burrata pecan lyche notabl salt burnt cheesecak smokey flavor caramel drizzl love dissonantli top fresh fruit,1,0.993

Atoboy,3,"Atoboy was a lovely experience. The outdoor seating area left much to be desired. A stark white wooden cubicle with no sort of decoration wasnt what I was expecting when booking in contrast to the interior of the beautiful restaurant. My favorite was the squash on pistachio puree. Very tasty.  The corn rice wasnt as delicious as I would have hoped. I was disappointed with desserts on the menu. I initially ordered the granita, and it didnt suit my palette. The waitress was kind enough to bring me the second desert, which was a sort of frozen custard. Good but not memorable. Aside from this , I would absolutely return and look forward to the next menu.",2022,atoboy love experi outdoor seat area left desir stark white wooden cubicl sort decor wasnt expect book contrast interior beauti restaur favorit squash pistachio pure tasti corn rice wasnt delici hope disappoint dessert menu initi order granita didnt suit palett waitress kind bring desert sort frozen custard good memor absolut return forward menu,0,0.8847

Atoboy,3,Just okay. The staff were very friendly and helpful and were clearly enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu. The seafood courses were very strong but the meat dishes fell a bit flat. The lamb was extremely fatty and portions were relatively small. Wine list has some good bottles but is eye wateringly expensive compared to other comparable menus. Interior decoration is nonexistent decor looks like a construction zone with chairs and tables installed. I m definitely glad I tried it as many of the flavours were unique and there were some standout dishes but $200+ per person for food and wine was really steep for the overall experience.,2022,staff friendli help enthusiast knowledg menu seafood cours strong meat dish fell bit flat lamb extrem fatti portion small wine list good bottl eye wateringli expens compar compar menu interior decor nonexist decor construct zone chair tabl instal glad flavour uniqu standout dish person food wine steep experi,0,0.9246

Atoboy,5,"Solid Top 5 restaurants in NYC!!! Walked into this place unplanned with a friend, just because it s nearby. Didn t expect such creative menu and flawless cooking techniques!! My friend and I sat by the bar and shared the $46, three course prefix. It turned out to be the best dining experience for us! I ordered a jalapeno rosso cocktail. It was very spicy but intriguing. First course was a crab dish   minced crab meat with pomelo, citrus sauce and mayo on top. I ve never seen this combination before it was surprisingly delicious. The slight tartness of pomelo and citrus sauce highlights how freshly sweet the crab meat is, while the mayo adds more comfort through creaminess. It was lightweight, refreshing, and perfectly curious. Yes curious, we now became very curious of what can happen next. Second dish we ordered the pork and shrimp dish. We didn t expect it to look like a tonkatsu - fried pork cutlet, sliced. However the crust is so minimalistic, non-greasy, again light weight, barely-there that you forget it has the fried element to it. Inside is the state of a perfect meatball   smooth paste of pork and shrimp nicely blended together, while remaining their own integrity   you can taste the tiny difference in texture between pork and shrimp, and their distinct flavors, but nothing outshines another. It s accompanied by some gochujang (korean sweet chili paste) below and cilantro on top, which adds just enough aroma and contrast. The third dish was galbi. My friend and I are both korean bbq lovers, however we agree that often times when grilled meats are still pink or bloody in the center, they taste of a mix of raw and cooked, can be ignored but still flawed. This dish is different. The accuracy on timing is well reflected on the tenderness and seasoning. Though the portion is small, the dish yet again is full of sophisticated flavors. Home made potato chips and what seems like stir fried kimchi perfectly counteract any greasiness and adds fun little crisp to the texture. We cannot ignore the well thought (or rather cooked) details. The homemade apple kimchi expanded our horizons on kimchi, and we thank it for that. Who knew apples can be pickled, so well! The starter chips   home made seaweed chips were out of this world, we even inquired whether it can be packaged for sale. As southern Chinese (meaning Chinese born and raised in the southern provinces), both of us have high standard for rice. We added $2 for a bowl of sweet potato rice, and kept the other one the plain white rice. Both are exactly the same amount of fluffiness and have the perfect amount of water content   not too dry, not too wet / sticky. That s harder to achieve than you think, at least most restaurants I ve tried don t fit that bill. The sweet potato rice was another item we were head over heels for. According to the restaurant, they placed sweet potato on top of white rice to steam together, but actually don t blend the physical sweet potato to the rice. It was the best rice we ve ever had! So subtlety sweet, as if every piece of rice is soaked in the best quality sweet potato juice. It s not overly sweet. We agreed that we could eat this rice alone as snacks. Outside of the prefix, we ordered two desserts. One is shy from the other. We recommend the one with spruced honey on top. Can t remember this name unfortunately. All to conclude is this also was amazing. The spruced honey adds such interesting smokiness to the theme, and the red bean paste is one of the best we ve tried too. Hope this review is helpful! I can t wait to bring loved ones here again! I love how this restaurant is more upscale without being hideously expensive, and how it makes asian fusion cuisine actually proud.",2020,solid top restaur nyc walk place unplan friend nearbi didn expect creativ menu flawless cook techniqu friend sat bar share prefix turn dine experi order jalapeno rosso cocktail spici intrigu crab dish minc crab meat pomelo citru sauc mayo top ve combin surprisingli delici slight tart pomelo citru sauc highlight freshli sweet crab meat mayo add comfort creami lightweight refresh perfectli curiou curiou curiou happen dish order pork shrimp dish didn expect tonkatsu fri pork cutlet slice crust minimalist greasi light weight bare forget fri element insid state perfect meatbal smooth past pork shrimp nice blend remain integr tast tini differ textur pork shrimp distinct flavor outshin accompani gochujang korean sweet chili past cilantro top add aroma contrast dish galbi friend korean bbq lover agre time grill meat pink bloodi center tast mix raw cook flaw dish accuraci time reflect tender season portion small dish full sophist flavor home made potato chip stir fri kimchi perfectli counteract greasi add fun crisp textur ignor thought cook detail homemad appl kimchi expand horizon kimchi knew appl pickl starter chip home made seawe chip world inquir packag sale southern chines mean chines born rais southern provinc high standard rice ad bowl sweet potato rice plain white rice amount fluffi perfect amount water content dri wet sticki harder achiev restaur ve don fit bill sweet potato rice item head heel restaur sweet potato top white rice steam don blend physic sweet potato rice rice ve subtleti sweet piec rice soak qualiti sweet potato juic overli sweet agre eat rice snack prefix order dessert shi recommend spruce honey top rememb conclud amaz spruce honey add interest smoki theme red bean past ve hope review help wait bring love love restaur upscal hideous expens make asian fusion cuisin proud,1,0.9983

The prix fixe menu makes you pick one dish each from three different sectiond as well as a dessert; because its unclear what differentiates each section, its a missed opportunity that the dishes dont all come out at the same time to be enjoyed together. Besides the food, I would describe the very utilitarian decor as sweatshop chic or what youd see in a movie about a dystopian future where people live underground.

Atoboy,5,"I really can t say enough about the food here. I m a big fan of creative culinary fare and honey, this is it! The deal here is that you get a tasting of 3 dishes per person and share it all family style. Everything can be split amongst multiple people. My friend and I went and got 6 dishes and split them.  Now that I know the deal, I ll come with at least 4 people next time. Why 4? Because we will cover most of the menu and yet still get at least 2 bites out of each dish. The sunchoke dish is amazing! Hands down the best of our batch. The sweet potato was lovely and served as a nice counterpoint to the sunchoke dish. They came at the same time (2nd course). The first course was a solid and more subtle start to the meal. The yellowtail was delicious and the golden beets both went beyond our expectations. I d have to say that everything so far has been perfectly balanced and had multiple textures and flavors on one plate. It showcases sophisticated flavor mapping and is consistently mindful of balance. Easier said than done people! The last course was the least impressive. We had the pork jowl and the octopus. The octopus was our least favorite. However, keep in mind that we both believed that at another restaurant we would have been pleased with this dish as it was. However, in light of the stiff competition on that menu, I d have to say that something had to come in last. The pork jowl wasn t as flavorful as I had hoped, but still a good dish. They were both just less inspired and execution of the flavors wasn t in the perfect balance and sophistication of the first 4 dishes. A waitress admitted that the 3rd course this season doesn t seem to be as strong as the first 2 courses. Oh well. But dessert...that sujjeongwa granita dessert was a perfect ending to the meal. It was refreshing, only slightly sweet and again, we are back to that wonderful flavor mapping and balance!

The place is really interesting, it looks like nothing from the outside, no lights, no windows, then you open this door and your in the this cool modern, minimal space. The place obviously emphasizes the importance of service to the everyone who works there. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. It also seems like they have the perfect level of servers to keep everything flowing uninterrupted. If needed a new glass of wine. Someone was on it as soon as the thought popped into my head. On to the food. Also all staff seemed to know every detail about every dish,  I which is often not the case is other restaurants  We ordered six different dishes plus two extras dishes plus two desserts so we tried a lot. The highlights for me were the beer tar tar and the sunchokes, my wifes favorites were the sunchokes and cod. For me I found the 1st and 2nd courses more interesting, but everything was amazing.  Very unique and delicious dishes presented beautifully. The pumpkin cheesecake was also fantastic. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.

Atoboy,5,"An awesome eclectic fusion of Korean with a great culinary imagination.  The menu is prixe fixe and you get to choose one dish from each of three different sections on the menu.  My 13 year old daughter absolutely love the octopus.  Some of the combination of flavors seems unusual such as the eggplant with dungeness crab, tomato and lemon which was a cold dish but was a marriage of flavors made in heaven!  I highly recommend trying that one!",2017,awesom eclect fusion korean great culinari imagin menu prix fix choos dish section menu year daughter absolut love octopu combin flavor unusu eggplant dung crab tomato lemon cold dish marriag flavor made heaven highli recommend,1,0.9337
