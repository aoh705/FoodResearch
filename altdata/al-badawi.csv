al Badawi,5,"Service, atmosphere, and food was amazing here. Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and there was a lot of space and it wasn t too busy, which is surprising because the food was phenomenal. Our waiter was really patient with us helping us select our dishes given we wanted to learn about their traditional Palestinian dishes they specialize in. He helped us choose some of the restaurants favorite appetizers and main dishes. The pita bread was warm and freshly done, even smoky after pulling it apart. The muhammarah was my favorite appetizer and the malfouf was great too. The Mansaf was delicious - the rice had soaked the flavor of the lamb stewed in a yogurt broth. The lamb was so tender and delicious. Portions were a great size. Family style do you can share dishes amongst each other. I can t wait to come back and try more traditional dishes!

Ordered the mansaf (lamb stewed in broth and yogurt over rice and flatbread) and it did not disappoint. We had two vegetarians in our party and they were more than satisfied with the falafel and the big spread of mezzes we ordered; we loved the zahir (cauliflower) in particular. I didnt get the shawarma this time, but its some of the best Ive ever had anywhere. Staff were super friendly and helpful, the floral displays in the restaurant add lots of charm, and of course Im glad to support a local Palestinian business during this time.

Couldnt decide what to eat so got a little help from the staff, and was encouraged to try Ouzi lamb from the main entree. Had chicken-filled slices as an appetizer, along with pita and olive oil dips - the dip with olive oil is so simple but such a rich & tasteful appetizer (reminded me of Bassams interview with Morgan) Had Arabic coffee, it was fresh and poured out of a pot, and the baklava was perfection. The serving size is generous & filling. You must bring a friend along I couldnt eat too much. The lamb is well-cooked & melts off the bone.

The pita was fantastic, hummus could ve used a little something. Can t put my finger on exactly what it s was missing but it was something. The lamb was lacking the flavor that I know it has the potential to have. The two items that stole the show were the pistachio flatbread and the 6 layer chicken dish. Absolutely delish!

We started with the mezze platter, kibbeh, and malfouf (stuffed cabbage rolls). Id come back for the malfouf alone, Im salivating just thinking about it. A true culinary wet dream! Kicking myself for not ordering the Kousa Mahshi (stuffed squash), which was one of my grandfathers fav dishes. We (a table of 5) then shared a few traditional mains, rather than opting for an XL family-sized dish or two: the Fattet Djaj / Fattat Jaj, Ouzi Lamb, and Fasoulia. The fattet was the star, but the other dishes were equally     delectable. The lamb and beef melt in your mouth. The chef came by to check on us several times, which was very sweet. One thing to note is that the restaurant is BYO, but theres a wine store down the block. My mom is hard of hearing, so the only drawback was that the dining room was a little noisy (it was a full house, for a good reason). The lighting could be a little dimmer, if Im going to nitpick, but it wasnt offensive.

The food is delicious and authentic - I especially recommend the Mezze Filistini, Lahma bil ajeen, fattat jaj, and ouzi lamb! Everything came out so quickly and the portion sizes were HUGE, even though we didnt order the family style -- everyone and I mean everyone got to leave with some extra food to take home. The BYOB option is also super nice & we were so surprised by how inexpensive the bill was at the end of the night. Also a tip: if you pay in cash, the total is priced less!

The food has 0 zero seasoning and I promise the most seasoned thing was the salad that came with my meal and it wasn t even a Palestinian salad. Just romaine lettuce and Italian dressing. My friends plate was cold and we were not treated well by the staff. My friend booked a month ago for her birthday dinner and when we came they didn t have her reservation on file. We were a group of 6, and they put down a bread basket with only 2 piece of bread inside. We were shocked. Then, we asked for more bread and they were visibly annoyed by us asking for decent service. They also placed one chair in the walkway then blamed one of us for blocking the path even though that s where the seat was placed? Then, a waiter asked one of US to push the tables out of the way! Back to the bread, we saw waiters give full plates of bread to other tables and that really hurt because seriously?? Two pieces of bread??!. Not to try and pull that card, but  We were the only black Muslims there. So idk. Also who in that restaurant is actually Palestinian or Arab? No one except for the hostess was Arab or Middle eastern. , so idk about the authenticity especially given the lack of flavor in the food. my simple mixed grill meal should not be so bland! Especially not for $40. The Hummus was good tho! anyway, I will not be coming here again.

Among them was Khawaja Asif, the esteemed ex-Foreign Minister, and his companions Syed Anwar Wasti, Rohail Dar, Rana Saeed, Malik Khuram, and Jan. The dinner was graciously hosted by Amir Razaq of Bronx, whose choice of venue added a delightful touch to our gathering. The culinary highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the mix grill. Each morsel was cooked to perfection, offering a symphony of flavors that danced on the palate. It was a dish that resonated well with our distinguished guests, encapsulating the essence of fine dining. A special mention must be made of the mint tea. It was not just a beverage but an experience in itself. The refreshing aroma and the subtle yet invigorating flavor provided a perfect counterpoint to the rich meal. As for the sweets, they were nothing short of awesome. Each bite was a blend of sweetness and texture, rounding off the meal beautifully. However, despite the excellent food and company, there was one aspect that detracted from our experience - the noise level. The restaurants ambiance was marred by a cacophony that made it challenging to engage in meaningful conversation. It was a significant inconvenience, especially given the stature of our guests and the importance of dialogue in such gatherings. In light of this, I find myself compelled to give the restaurant a 3-star rating. While the culinary experience was exceptional, the noisy environment was a considerable drawback.

The pita bread / labneh / side hummus and side baba ganoush were outstanding as were the lamb chops. They serve you 5 lamb chops with rice, hummus, baba, chopped cucumbers and tomatoes, all for $34 (they informed me that it used to cost $28 for the same dish on their menu, before the inflation spike hit the economy). I highly recommend this place, even if it does have a few quirks (no soda/tea/coffee menu provided at all, you just have to ask the waiter for whatever drink you may want  and some of the tables are not flat, the wood curves up at the sides, unclear why, seems like it would make dining difficult (?)).

Never asked us if we wanted drinks. We ordered the mezza, mussakhan and lamb ouzi. The mezza was superb. The mussakhan had at least 3-4 onions. It was very good but way too much onions and sumac. It was all I tasted. Her ouzi wasn t palatable. I know cinnamon is used but it was used so heavy handed here that we couldn t eat it. The only thing that saved this was the lamb was tender and spiced right. If you re going to represent our beautiful Palestinian food, please do so with care and honor. Hire people who understand the food and can explain things to your diners. There is so much appropriation of our food and it made me so happy to see an authentic restaurant.

al Badawi,4,"After a positive review in The New Yorker, and my fondness for Arab food I had to trek all the way here to find out how good the food was. Well prepared, generous portions, tasty and made to order are big pluses. As a solo diner could not order a main course because they are big enough to share, so had to limit my choices to appetizers, the best of all three being the kibbeh, which was light and fluffy and fried to perfection. The cauliflower on the zahir was burnt in places and that added an unwanted bitterness to the mix, that the tahini with pomegranate molasses could not disguise. Labneh was refreshing but could have been thicker. The scene stealer was dessert, out of baklava the lovely waitress suggested knafe, a baked cheese with syrup and chopped pistachios which was the perfect pairing with my arab coffee. In winter the place was so overheated that the front door needed to be opened a few times to prevent a collective meltdown. My advice is to wear layers that you will shed after five minutes of sitting down.",2023,posit review yorker fond arab food trek find good food prepar gener portion tasti made order big pluse solo diner order main big share limit choic appet kibbeh light fluffi fri perfect cauliflow zahir burnt place ad unwant bitter mix tahini pomegran molass disguis labneh refresh thicker scene stealer dessert baklava love waitress suggest knafe bake chees syrup chop pistachio perfect pair arab coffe winter place overh front door need open time prevent collect meltdown advic wear layer shed minut sit,1,1

al Badawi,1,"I wish that there was a no star option to give it to that place. As an arab and a big fan of Mansaf, this place has the worst mansaf ever. TBH, the meat was very good but this is not a mansaf. I tried mansaf in arab countries and Jordanian and Palestinian restaurants and it is totally different. Here is how it is not mansaf: 1) the milk that is served with mansaf should be Jameed. Jameed has a very different taste and its color is more yellow than white as you can see in the picture. Also, it does not have the taste of Jameed. It seems to be a regular milk. 2) there should be a special kind of bread under the rice called sherak bread. They used a regular bread which is catastrophic. The sherak is a thick kind of bread that does not dissolve from the milk as you can see from the picture. Also the place is extremely expensive. The mansaf costs $49 and it was the worst. Also they add a credit card fee although this very high cost. I tried to complain but the manager was not there as she left. I don t know how the manager leave before the restaurant was closed. I was extremely hungry and I didn t think to complain earlier. The mezza appetizer was ok except that red thing that is shown in the picture, it was tasteless. I don t recommend to try the mansaf and the mezza plates. I didn t try other plates, may be they are good. **************************************************************** UPDATE after the restaurants owner reply: Anyone can check mansaf pictures over the internet and they can see the difference. Regarding the owners reply, TBH, I miss-explained when I said that sharak is a thick bread. Yes it is a thin bread but it never completely dissolve from the milk. Also, I said that they were not using sharak bread, and they used a regular bread as you can see in the picture, the owners ignored this comment and replied to a small detail which is the sharak is a thin or thick bread. Regarding the milks color, I am skeptical that it differs from one place to another, I tried it from different restaurants and different arab cookers from different cities and all of them are more yellow and thicker. May be the owners are correct but personally I have never seen something like that. It was like a regular milk. Also, notice I am saying like, I am not accusing that it is a regular milk. Anyway, it does not matter. The most important thing that matters is that the restaurant owners didnt even try to apologize or try to approach to understand my concerns more. BTW, you can check my profile and you will see that I rated other mansaf restaurant. Then, you would be able to see the difference.",2023,star option give place arab big fan mansaf place worst mansaf tbh meat good mansaf mansaf arab countri jordanian palestinian restaur total mansaf milk serv mansaf jame jame tast color yellow white pictur tast jame regular milk special kind bread rice call sherak bread regular bread catastroph sherak thick kind bread dissolv milk pictur place extrem expens mansaf cost worst add credit card fee high cost complain manag left don manag leav restaur close extrem hungri didn complain earlier mezza appet red thing shown pictur tasteless don recommend mansaf mezza plate didn plate good updat restaur owner repli check mansaf pictur internet differ owner repli tbh miss explain sharak thick bread thin bread complet dissolv milk sharak bread regular bread pictur owner comment repli small detail sharak thin thick bread milk color skeptic differ place restaur arab cooker citi yellow thicker owner correct person regular milk notic accus regular milk matter import thing matter restaur owner didnt apolog approach understand concern btw check profil rate mansaf restaur differ,-1,1

It usually get quite busy during dinner on fridays/the weekend but if you go at a different time, you shouldn t have trouble getting a seat without a reservation. My opinion of the food have changed since the first time I visited the restaurant. Most appetizers on the menu are worth a try so you don t need to hold back; Falafel, hummus, kibbeh, etc. are all great. Main dishes are mostly presented as a shared item for the table, very suitable for family-style dining and large gathering. First thing that comes to the table is always their freshly-baked bread with olive oil and mixed seasoning. If you sit at the bar, you can see the bread in the making, make sure to ask for a fresh one there. I tried the mixed shawarma & cheese flatbread and the fattat lahma the first time I visit; to be honest, they were not my favorite. I thought the meat was very dry on the flatbread and even still dry with the sauce on the platter. Yet, I gave al Badawi another chance and I found myself happily cleaning the Ouzi Beef platter. The meat is juicy, melting in your mouth; the rice with the almonds creates such combination of soft and crunchy texture that gets you addicted.

I just thought that approach was uncalled for considering we called prior to make sure us coming was okay. Also she was hesitant to seat us and when she did she gave us the menus and said do you know what you want before we even opened the menus. Her approach could have been more Hi, were so glad to have you! However we do close in 40 minutes so I want you to be aware your dining experience may be a little more rushed than usual. Anyways we ordered with another waitress who never mentioned the closing time. The place wasnt packed but we werent the last people to leave. There were three other tables who stayed past closing which made me feel like the experience with the hostess was unnecessary. She seemed a little younger than me and I get it, at the end of the day you want to go home, but you can be kinder about it because part of dining out is the experience with the staff. We were tired and had trecked from New Jersey and heard amazing things about this place, and how warm and friendly everyone was.

There is no way that was enough bread, when I asked for more I was informed there wasnt anymore bread, with no acknowledgement that was ridiculous considering the restaurant was open for TWO more hours, and how exactly were we supposed to finish the meal? No offer of bringing any rice or anything else which could have been eaten instead with the mezze. I ended up buying grocery store pita on my way home to eat with my leftovers - that is just sad and I wont be returning.

The Muhammarah was good, very flavorful and different, and complemented the pita well. The Msakhan chicken was delicious, it reminded me of rotisserie chicken.

Its not easy maintaining food quality during periods of high volume. Food was so-so. Service was inattentive and lacked professionalism. It wasnt a terrible experience, it was a we expected better from the establishment, they simply did not deliver. Heres what we ordered. Everything was  prepared fresh and was cooked well. The issue was seasoning and flavor. If the food had been flavor we would have been satisfied and would have forgone the not so excellent service. But this wasnt the case. Heres what we ordered: Chicken Ouzi, of the dishes we ordered this was the best. It had the most flavor, was cooked well and had the best presentation. Ive had this dish before all throughout the country and in Palestine. It was underwhelming for what it could have been. Not terrible but not something Id reorder if the competition in Brooklyn can deliver a better version of this dish. Zatar with olive oil, where was the side of olive oil? Our table didnt receive any. We asked again the servers mustve forgotten. Dish was prepared fresh however it was not as tasty as it could have been. Again if I know spot that can prepare this dish with more consideration than Im going to the competition. Lamb Mansaf, heres where we were really let down. The lamb was cooked to perfection, it fell of the bone was tender and wasnt dry at all. The problem? There was absolutely no flavor. None whatsoever. It was as if we had requested a no seasoning, no spice version of the dish. Why spend $38 on a lamb dish with no flavor when the competition could blow you out of the water for $25? Unfortunately we were disappointed. I wanted more from Al Badawi and Im sure they can do better. Their staff was busy and they were working hard. I dont want to undermine their dedication to their craft, lets focus on improving the flavor in the dishes. Food that tastes phenomenal has a lasting impact on the customer. You eat something delicious and you tell your friends, co workers, business partners, and family members to come eat here. I cant make that recommendation just yet. Lets give them a third and final try to see if they can redeem themselves. Will be back with an open mind to try the kafta hi tahini. Its one of my favorite dishes.

I proceeded to tell her that there are actually different types of halal and to ask the owner. I saw her making a phone call and she came back to us to confirm it was hand slaughtered so we decided to stay. We were then assigned a different waitress after being seated. When ordering fatoosh, the menu didn t mention anything about  sumac  (you can take a look) so when I asked the waitress if there was any in the salad  I had to repeat myself a few times to which she said  I don t know what that is   I said never mind and ordered it anyway. After our food came, she didn t tend to us for the rest of the evening. The food was definitely delicious so that made the drive worth it.

My tween son and I were traveling and didnt choose some of the more traditional options (maklubeh, etc) because there would have been too much food.

al Badawi,5,"I m a fan of Ayat so to say I was excited about Al-Badawi opening up in downtown Brooklyn. would be the understatement of a lifetime. I willingly make the trip out to Bay Ridge from Manhattan without even thinking about it. But now I can get the same incredible food with a shorter trip. What really makes this place stand out is the quality of the food, the hospitality of the staff and owners, and the incredible decor. So basically it excels at everything is what I mean to say. I started off with the mezze platter, which is a must order at here and Ayat. They don t just make one great dip, they make a variety of great dips. Great? I mean amongst the best I ve had anywhere. They also serve a freshly baked pita along with them, which seems better here than Ayat - likely because it s coming right out of the pizza oven just feet away. As a main, I had the Maklouba, which is such a unique and satisfying dish, I wonder why I only just recently discovered it. I wish I would have known about it before but I m glad I know where to get it. This dish is really special - it can t be started to be prepared until ordered due to the preparation of the dish. A dish truly worth waiting and traveling for. So what really differentiates this place from Ayat is the setup - both are beautifully decorated, but this one has a little more to it as part of a more casual sit down place. I m glad they added this here, as I ve seen a number of reviews for Ayat mention some confusion around the ordering. No need to worry here. I truly think this is one of the best restaurants in NYC and really anywhere. There s so much more I want to try here (and will), from the pizzas to the main meals to the fresh fish selection prominently displayed. It s also nice to have the BYOB option here - the meals go great with a nice red wine. And they provide some nice cups to drink from. Oh and the dishes they serve in are awesome, just like at Ayat. What ultimately really gets me going about this place is the hospitality. I spoke with the owner outside after the meal for 10 minutes, discussing how incredible his restaurants are. All night, he was handling orders, working in the kitchen to make sure everything moved perfectly. He told me about how special these places are and what it means to be able to introduce so many people to this cuisine. Such a friendly man, such a great chef. I look forward to talking with him each time I visit as I can tell how much effort and hard work he puts in to making this place as amazing as it is. It s also great to see that the owner of nearby Yemen Cafe (another great restaurant) is co-owner here. He was also as involved the night I dined in to make sure everything was moving along just right. As I type this review out, I really can t wait to go back and bring more people.

al Badawi,4,"There s so much to be said about this restaurant! I ll start off with the bad since there s not that much negativity. I felt that overall the quality of the food wasn t very impressive. It really could ve been much better. I had the mixed shawarma platter and I felt that it could ve been much fresher and warmer all together. The flavors weren t very strong in my opinion. However, there were many things impressive about this experience overall. For starters, the restaurant is incredibly spacious for one of Brooklyn s prime locations. The decor and aesthetics of the restaurant are phenomenal! More importantly, the servers provide excellent service. Upon being seated, I was provided with complimentary olives, olive oil and a spice mix along with water served in their traditional jugs and cups. Furthermore, they provided me with not one but TWO complimentary generous service of fresh pita bread. I generally don t like pita bread, but there s was incredibly unique and flavorful. And finally, I found that their portions were incredibly generous. While I ordered one platter, I was barely able to finish half! And it was priced at only $16. While I wasn t entirely impressed by my order, I felt that many other dishes ordered by those around me such as Mansaf and baked chicken would probably be better. I will definitely be returning to explore more of their menu!",2022,restaur ll start bad neg felt qualiti food wasn impress ve mix shawarma platter felt ve fresher warmer flavor weren strong opinion thing impress experi starter restaur incred spaciou brooklyn prime locat decor aesthet restaur phenomen importantli server provid excel servic seat provid complimentari oliv oliv oil spice mix water serv tradit jug cup provid complimentari gener servic fresh pita bread gener don pita bread incred uniqu flavor final found portion incred gener order platter bare finish half price wasn impress order felt dish order mansaf bake chicken return explor menu,1,1
