Shu Jiao Fu Zhou,5,"This storied cheap eats spot in Chinatown was suggested to me at least a hundred times before I was able to make the trek down and try them out.  I had visited other spots in the area before like Wo Hop, Wah Fung, and some others so I had high expectations when many people said this spot was just as good if not better. We decided to get the dish most suggested to us (the wheat peanut butter noodles) and then also added one we really wanted to try (the pork and chive dumplings).  The woman at the counter was very friendly and spoke good English (which in some spots is surpringly an issue).  For the two dishes and two cans of soda it was only $9! The peanut butter noodles were unlike anything I ve had before.  They did not have a Thai peanut taste really (which is what I was expecting) but they didn t exactly just taste like peanut butter either.  I enjoyed the sauce a great deal.  The noodles also were a great texture.  They were similar to a thin egg noodle but they had longer length similar to any long style pasta like spaghetti or fettuccine.  I would absolutely order these again, and trust when I say that my next trip to Chinatown will have these included. The steamed pork and chive dumplings were also a huge hit.  The filling had excellent flavor, a nice texture to the outer skin, and after you added a little chili oil there were was a lot of dimensions of flavor.  I enjoyed these a lot and I think I d enjoy them just as much if they were pan fried so half had a crust to them.  We had dumplings at other spots on this day and these were my favorite of them all. Trust that we will be back here for sure and will try out some soup and other items as well as get these again.

The peanut noodles were $3, and were coated in a delicious sauce, not too peanut-y. The dumplings were so juicy, and well balanced. This place is packed, and also sell frozen dumplings, if you d like to have them after hours. Our order came out within minutes. Note that seating is limited, and you might have to share a table with others, but everyone including customers are friendly and welcoming to sit with.

I wanted to try their dumplings and ordered chicken and mushroom dumplings along with veg soup. The dumplings were piping hot and were filling, the chicken in it was properly cooked and the minced mushroom didnt make me realize that they had added it in the mixture. Top it up with a bit of hot sauce and chilli oil, it tasted good. The soup was amazing too! I have always liked the soup at Asian restaurants, its always good to have them. The noodles were really soft and the veggies in it were boiled well. The broth was  well.. you know adjust according to our taste by adding the spice and it turned out to be good! Overall it felt good. Its a cash only place and not much of an ambiance.

Shu Jiao Fu Zhou,5,"Visiting NYC for the first time and saw a vlog about this place so we wanted to give it a try. Its definitely a must go. The price is right and the dumplings are amazing. We also tried the peanut butter noodles and my kids finished it before I could have a taste. The place was packed, but the wait wasnt long. We ordered to go but had a table open up so we dined in. Worth it as the chilli oil was also very good. I personally liked mixing it with the black sauce they had at the table too. Not sure what its called but it along with the chilli oil made the dumplings even more delicious. We thought we ordered enough to have leftovers to pack back to the hotel but before we knew it, it was all gone. If you got preteen to teenage kids and visiting NYC, give this place a try. Its in Chinatown too so theres tons more things to do and eat, well worth the trip.",2023,visit nyc time vlog place want give price dumpl amaz peanut butter noodl kid finish tast place pack wait wasnt long order tabl open dine worth chilli oil good person mix black sauc tabl call chilli oil made dumpl delici thought order leftov pack back hotel knew preteen teenag kid visit nyc give place chinatown ton thing eat worth trip,1,0.7184

Left the place around 12 as it was getting crowded and my seat was needed. Had the noodles in peanut sauce, fishball soup and pork/chives dumplings. Noodles had a great texture which I really enjoyed even though Im not a big fan on such flat noodles. Peanut sauce had some good flavour to it but needed a little extra vinegar and chilli oil (which are readily available together with sriracha). Soup was just a plain soup with slight flavouring probably from the fishballs and abit of salt/msg. Fishballs were good but not fantastic. Got a nice bite to it and flavourful enough. Theyre a Fuzhou specialty with meat in it so when you bite into them, the meat juices spurts out which is pretty enjoyable. Best dish has got to be the dumplings. Really tasty and I just couldnt get enough of them. Skin was smooth and the meat filling was just delicious. Pretty much every table had some variations of dumplings on their table so that tells you all you need to know. All of that was only for $9. Cheap and delicious.

The noodles were chewy and the sauce was peanutty and flavorful, awesome! I just wish they had some chili oil for me to add to it; it would have been the perfect combination. The fish balls were quite good as well, though the meat inside wasnt very flavorful. The fish ball outside was quite chewy though not as soft as I thought it would be. The soup it came with was really good too, especially after I added the white pepper. For $2 each (including tax, and since you pay first you dont need to pay tip), the noodles and the fish ball soup are definitely a great bargain! I also tried my friends steamed dumplings which were also good (the soy sauce they have there isnt strictly soy sauce and its really delicious - I want to find out what it is!). The skin was a bit thick, though it was quite chewy. Very simple meal, but quite satisfying and tasty! Downside is everything here is plastic :( [Edit Dec 4, 2021] Havent been here for ages and mostly forgot about it, but its great! Changed location and upgraded the inside, its no longer dingy and falling apart - theres now proper tables and chairs and lighting, much cleaner feeling too.

My go-to is the large pork and cabbage dumplings which comes with ten pieces along with the peanut butter noodles. Cash only, $6.75 including tax for it all, amazing!

They were more heavy handed on the chives which prefer. The dumplings come out steaming hot and just a very small sip of porky juice. It has a nice blend of the chives and pork but there is this subtle sweetness that hints you just as you swallow. They are cheap as ever and a large serving of 10 would fill you up. There isnt any chili oil here but rather sriracha, soy sauce and black vinegar. You dont really need anything else to top the dumplings because they are flavored very well. The pork ball broth reminds me more of pork wontons with barely there skin. The broth has subtle fish flavor and tartness. I suspect that there is some vinegar.

You will walk in, pay, sit, and they will bring you your food on styrofoam. In about 15 minutes you will be on your way. They dont serve water or tea, that sort of thing. So on the service front, its really a 1-2 star kind of experience. Honestly, there is no decor and there is no service. The place is runned down. The dumplings though were a solid 5 stars. So I am honestly thinking of this as a 3-4 star kind of experience, based largely on the pork and chive dumplings. But because this is a place where you can sort of fill up for about $10 per person, I am edging that up to 4 stars. Additionally, the soup ordered wasnt really memorable. It was served in a plastic take-out container. One time, I walked here to check it out given its great reviews and the girl I was with was like, no. And I think she had it right. While the dumplings are rated highly, we need more than this. There isnt much complexity to the menu items.

They ll probably tell you to go to Vanessa s. on Eldridge Street. If things are really dire, they might even send you to the 14th Street location, or the one on Bedford Avenue. But here s the truth: Vanessa s Dumplings is kind of bad. They re not bad, say if you re at a strip mall in Connecticut. But they re thick and often greasy, and more importantly, all you need to do is walk about 20 steps to have what might be the best dumplings in Manhattan. On the corner of Broome and Eldridge, about a quarter block up from Vanessa s, is Shu Jiao Fu Zhou, a spot you could easily walk by without noticing - no less going in. Don t make that mistake. For $2, you can get 6 perfectly steamed, smooth, truly delightful dumplings with a pork filling that is almost sweet. They don t come fried, and if you can t deal with that, you don t really deserve to be here anyway. For $3, you can have 10, and for an extra $2, you should add on a plate of their also delicious wheat noodles with peanut butter sauce.
