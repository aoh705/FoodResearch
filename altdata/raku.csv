Raku,5,"My family and I were on our way to another restaurant when the smell of the broth lured us in to Raku instead. I had the kitsune udon. The noodles were cooked to perfection, not too soft with the right amount of chew. I got a side of maitake tempura as well, the batter was crunchy and the mushrooms juicy and tender, like a chicken thigh but with that distinct nuttiness.

It was such a narrow seat that if I had been a little fatter, it would have been impossible to sit. I couldnt even stretch my legs properly. (Because it wasnt a real seat, it was just a makeshift, absurd place!!) I even saw other empty seats, but the manager told me there was no seat and I should either wait longer or just sit down.

I came here alone on my lunch break today as on a cold rainy day, my heart, mind, and soul immediately go to a Raku meal. This is a fantastic place for a solo meal to just come and enjoy your own company... while we are on the topic I get so annoyed when people be posting about how they are going on solo meals. Like cant you just go do that and not post about it? Was it really a solo meal if you gotta tell everyone about it?..... Well I guess Im doing that now just in Yelp form ahahaha damn. The Niku Udons spice level is just enough to make your nostrils run and let out one of those quick little woooo breaths out of your mouth, which is my idyllic spice level. The voluminous bowl, which consists of a light flavorful broth, silk noodles, beef short-rib, nori sansho chili oil, tendon, and honeycomb tripe is my hangover cure. Well that and a couple puffs of a pre-roll but thats neither here nor there. I let out an audible wow on my final sip of the broth, as my soul needed it. My soul been hella tired lately idk why. My only complaint is that $27 before tax and tip is just steep. It cant be a weekly occurrence for me, as much as I would like it to. Once a quarter vibes smh.

With the exception of our Yaki Udon, which had giant chunks of undercooked cabbage that made it unpleasant and almost impossible to eat, and zero maitake mushrooms, wich are supposed to be there. But the sour notes are ambiance and service. The noise level, encouraged by absurdly and unnecessarily high music, is out of control. I measured over 85db. How can anyone enjoy dinner while going deaf? Service. In the middle of dinner the two waiters disappeared ((already not enough, and very hard to grab), and were nowhere to be found for several minutes. Zero service. Clients completely abandoned and perplexed. Our waitress in particular obviously hates her job, and was there against her will, judging by the way she treated us and others, including spilling a drink on another client because she wanted to rush cleanup. We had to beg for water. Their main goal was removing dishes and glasses, whether you were finished or not. Last call includes drinks, so god forbid you re still eating a dish you ordered and paid for and need something else to drink. You can die of thirst and they ll make sure to tell you in a very rude manner. To top it off, when you pay the bill you re offered the options of tipping 20% to 30%, no other choices, especially tipping less. Bottom line? Great food. Would I go back. Never. If they understand that the time to treat your customers like dirt is gone, they ll survive. If not, I doubt it. Chef Ishizuka, your food is too good to be served by rude waiters.

Some restaurants would have the tempura served in the same bowl as the soup, leaving it soggy. However, to my relief, this wasn t done here. The tempura also comes with an umeboshi which was really refreshing. I normally don t like pickled plum, but it was so yummy. And the interior design/vibe was clean and chic (but traditional). I had a mid-afternoon reservation and was sad to find that there was no more matcha for dessert. The waiter recommended a sesame-apricot dessert that was surprisingly good! I wouldn t have thought the two flavors would go so well together, but it was creative and sweet. My only con was the hostess. My reservation was for a larger party but, due to certain circumstances, the party size became somewhat smaller. After we were seated, she had asked why the other members had to cancel? The question and the comments afterward were probably not meant to be rude, but it was received as a hurtful probe that, as a hostess, shouldn t have been questioned or said. I wish I had said something to warn her not to ask or comment on such things with future parties, but I didn t have the courage to do so.

If you want an egg or fish cake (what I thought was standard) you have to order that. The bowl you get can easily serve two...in fact I saw some people doing that. The broth I think was a chicken/pork. It was excellent. The noodles are amazing. Firm but the right amount of chew. If you like udon this is definitely the best udon in NYC.

Its worth trying the mackerel sushi (?) at least once, but the size of the rice is compared to the size of the fish. It was a bit disappointing that it was so big, but its still a great udon restaurant that always comes to mind...

There was really nothing else to the meal which was slightly disappointing. It was a very expensive meal for noodles, broth, a tiny bit of spinach, and one relatively small sheet of tofu bean curd. To get any additional toppings would make it even more expensive so I declined ordering more. Would recommend a vegan going here with nonvegan friends as there are convenient options for everyone but maybe not vegans exclusively. Vegetarian options: There were clearly labeled vegetarian and vegan options. They were less expensive than their meat counterparts but they were lacking comparatively.

We were led to a 6-person table and sat between two other couples- the lack of space/ partitions made both of us immediately uneasy and I wish the option to wait for table seating was offered. Nonetheless, we came here for the famed udon.. that ended up coming after over 20 minutes of waiting. The couple who were sat next to us at the same time literally got their food, finished, and left before either of us got our food. I understand its busy but that was no excuse for the service. My partner had his udon almost slammed down on the table wordlessly. When it came time to pay, the server stared over his shoulder as he input the tip and signed, which I found highly unusual as they would typically look away out of courtesy. Service aside, the udon truly was spectacular. It was thinner than the usual udon noodles but the al dente texture and the way it mixed in with the sauce was fantastic. I got the jaja cold soba and the heat of the spicy miso pork offset the cold noodles perfectly.

The food? Pretty awesome, depending on what you order and your mood. The Chicken Tatsu-age aka Japanese fried chicken is freaking delicious. Its marinated chicken that has been lightly coated with potato starch and fried. Its lighter and crispier than Chicken Karaage (also a fried chicken dish, but not served here)--and dare I say, this fried chicken is  just as good. Its served with a mildly spicy dipping sauce. $8 (small)/$12 (large) Tantan Udon is a MUST ORDER! Its bowl of Udon in warm broth + spicy miso pork, ground peanuts, and egg. First, this is a spicy  dish. The layers of flavor are there from first slurp of Udon to the last. This dish works for me from the presentation in the giant stone/ceramic bowl to the colors of the broth to that mix of savory scents to perfectly cooked Udon. Again, order this. $14 Drinks?

I would ve preferred if it came raw and I can dip in the hot broth myself, like the Vietnamese Pho, so I know it is indeed the A5 marbling piece of meat. Or come in as bigger chunks, like a small steak, that I can still see the marbling. The tofu on the side is also disappointing, at about the same thickness of the beef, I was expecting it to be able to soak up the broth when eating it, but instead it is overwhelmingly sweet Looking at what my partner ordered, big chunks of marinated beef, and looking back at my bowl, it was not a good experience, Broth is good, udon is chewy, and good to get some frozen grapes as after meal dessert.

The fried chicken was also amazing. It wasnt too oily and tasted great hot. The crust was very crispy, creating the perfdct contrast to the soft inside. Not to mention, this place has great vegan options! In terms of service, everyone was extremely friendly and provided me with a sense of comfort and relaxation.

It is incredibly hard to do a good dashi (broth) and they re flat udon was soft, chewy and with a good bite. We will definitely be back! They also have attentive service with knowledgeable servers who can answer any questions you may have of the menu. The only thing I would say is that the custard of the green tea tiramisu is slightly too stiff/over whipped. It had the consistently of a cheesecake whereas I prefer it to be a bit more pillow-y and soft so it could soak the sponge properly.

I got the gyunan which is a clear beef broth with thinly sliced beef. I also added the mochi topping to my udon and I loved it. The flavor is pretty neutral but it s chewy and soft and you get 2 hefty pieces which I thought was the perfect amount. Overall I enjoyed my udon but flavor-wise it wasn t mind blowing and I think it s expensive for udon.

Raku,5,"Hands down our favorite place. 1. Best iron noodles in town.  They are chewy unlike many over cooked udon noodles at other places. 2. Broth is flavorful.  It s always piping hot and never too salty. 3. Toppings are amazing, from mountain veggies (not sure what that actually means, but it includes different roots/stems/leaf of delicious veggies).  While I love my meat and seafood, I always go for the mountain veggie or mushroom bowl. 4. Generous portions!  You can also get extra noodles on the side for $3. Fried chicken is also delicious!  While I won t say it s the best I ve had, it s perfect appetizer before the best bowl of udon in NYC.

The service was prompt and excellent. They had our food out in very short order and it was very enjoyable. I had the fried pork and rice dish which was very good but (to me) just short of 5 stars.

Raku,1,"I visited Raku on a Wednesday night for dinner for two at around 7 p.m. Still, the restaurant was full, and the hostess (receptionist?) told us to leave a name and number and expected around one-hour wait time, which is fine and understandable and even made me even more excited about dining here. However, the hostess was extremely rude when asking for my contact information. She was impolite and impatient when I was giving my name, which is a four-letter name, and told me to provide her with a whatever name. NO. It is my name, and if I can spell Raku, a four-letter word, the restaurant should be able to get my name correctly. I felt disrespected. This was such a disappointing first interaction with the restaurant that I wanted to walk out, but my friend insisted on dining there, so we did. We ordered niku udon and oyaku don and both were delicious. We wanted Chawanmushi for appetisers, but the server told us the wait time is over 30 minutes. Disappointed again, I decided not to get the egg; however, the server got pushy and told me to order that dish. He only dropped it after the fourth time I said no: I dont want the appetiser served after I finish my mains. Overall, this was an awful visit, and I dont recommend anyone to spend money in this restaurant. Even though the food was quite good and the portion was huge, there are many Japanese restaurants in NYC with equally tasty food and much better service.",2020,visit raku wednesday night dinner restaur full hostess receptionist told leav number expect hour wait time fine understand made excit dine hostess extrem rude contact inform impolit impati give letter told provid spell raku letter word restaur correctli felt disrespect disappoint interact restaur want walk friend insist dine order niku udon oyaku don delici want chawanmushi appetis server told wait time minut disappoint decid egg server pushi told order dish drop fourth time dont appetis serv finish main aw visit dont recommend spend money restaur food good portion huge japanes restaur nyc equal tasti food servic,-1,-0.5122

We only had to wait 30 minute so it wasn t that bad but you can save yourself the time if you can. The restaurant itself is very nice. There s two dining areas with tables and a bar area. We sat at the bar and the waiter was very attentive. For food we shared the tarsus-age (fried chicken). It was one of the better Japanese fried chicken I ve had. It came out piping hot and the pieces were pretty big. Definitely a must get if you go there. I got the chikara with a shiitake mushroom, toasted nori, and a poached egg. My friend got the niku with toasted nori and a shiitake. All the toppings come on the side so you can add them in as you like. I was surprised at how but the shiitake mushroom was actually so if you re a mushroom lover you won t be disappointed. The broth for both was extremely flavorful. Mine had a cleaner taste and was clearer. Great udon too. You can tell they re homemade because the ends are irregularly shaped and some areas are thinner or thicker.

Personally I like this location more than the original one in East Village as the seat is always available and the high quality of food is well maintained here too. The service is quick. Raku s noodle is very chewy and cut in perfect length - not too long to tangle or too short to feel it before swallow. Both the veggie option and meaty option are good depending on what mood. The gyunan udon is my favorite by far as the rich soup is unbeatable. A half star rounded up in my rating that can be improved is the beef meat - it might be pre-cooked to get rid of the impurities and make the stock cleaner, but the knock-on impact is the tough meat.",2019,noodl person raku noodl make return person locat origin east villag seat high qualiti food maintain servic quick raku noodl chewi cut perfect length long tangl short feel swallow veggi option meati option good depend mood gyunan udon favorit rich soup unbeat half star round rate improv beef meat pre cook rid impur make stock cleaner knock impact tough meat,1,0.8519

Raku,2,"Totally HEARTBROKEN!!! I read such great reviews on this place and it was AWFUL service. Our reservation was 5:30 and we were kept waiting about 10 minutes or so. The booth was not ready for me to sit and I didnt like that the bathrooms were down a steep flight of steps. Anyone who is handicapped must avoid it. Next we ordered the meal. We were told the steak-dish  was already sold out and do keep in mind it was only 6:20. We had Chicken tatsuta-age, 6 fried chicken in a dish that came with a piece of lemon slice and very hot mayo. When I asked for more lemon... I actually got another small slice. For $8 give me LEMON! Next we got the big bowls of udon with a huge wooden spoon. The 3 bowls were NOT brought to the table at one time. The soup was good a bit to salty for my taste buds. The noodle texture was fresh and soft. Nameko Udon, Chicken Udon with  lots of dark meat which I am not fond of, and Udon with fried shrimp that was served on a plate so it didnt get soggy. I am also accustomed to taking my udon from the larger bowl into smaller bowls to make it easier to consume and I had to ask for BOWLS. The waiter returned with 1 bowl. Well, guess what He had to walk back with 2 more. Is it to hard for this waiter to be a tad more into his customers. He didnt introduce himself, we started with a waitress who never returned and it was like asking anyone who passed by for Service. My son totally told the waiter it was my birthday and to serve the desert with a candle. Well, they handed us the bill without even asking if we wanted anything else. My son-- gave the waiter a stare-- which I didnt understand and asked for the desert list. Well $10 later getting this cake with whisky ice cream, there was no Candle and he was very very disappointed. Food was fine. But for $70 worth of food I didnt like the service.

When I saw that the specialty is udon, I immediately added it to my mental wishlist. Well, my wish came true, and it was everything I hoped it would be and more. We had a reservation for 6pm and we were seated immediately close to the window. The service was impeccable, and the server diligently explained all of the popular favorites. There are lots of vegetarian options, and they can even alter the udon broth to make it vegan. We wanted to order EVERYTHING. The tuna tartare with quail egg appetizer was so tender, we were amazed. (Fair warning that the egg is raw.) The vegetable gyoza were perfectly pan fried, not too oily. The cadence/speed at which the food came out was phenomenal. We were very hungry, and the servers watched us carefully to pace the food. Because J is pescatarian, we ordered the vegetable tempura udon and the eel donburi. The donburi was by far the standout. INCREDIBLY flavorful, with a fluffy egg concoction woven around the delicious eel. Rice was moist and perfect. Udon broth is sweet, and adding the spice mixture creates the umami. We added nameko mushrooms, poached egg, and mochi. I honestly cant imagine a better dinner. The portions are very generous, and the service has such attention to detail. They made sure we had all the proper sharing bowls and utensils ahead of time. The ambiance manages to find a balance between bustling, peaceful, and unpretentious. Our leftovers were boxed up neatly, and we never felt rushed even though there was a line waiting for tables. I am just so impressed and I cant wait to come back.

The new location is much more roomy and airy, tables are spaced out from each other and not crowded. Its much quieter as well, and more relaxed. At the original location I felt I had to eat pretty quickly because the tables turnover frequently, but at this location I could take my time and eat at my own pace. Decor is minimalist but contemporary with a lot of off white and light, natural wood. There are two bathrooms located downstairs. We ordered a bowl of udon each, I ordered the chikara udon (chicken, negi, and mochi) with an add on poached egg. My friend got the sansai (mountain vegetable) udon. The udon here is so good. I have visited Udon Maruka in Japan and its better here at Raku. The noodles have a luscious chew and are very smooth! The broth and meat are good as well, but the noodles... are the star of the show. The broth is delicious though too. I enjoy steaming my face in the large bowl before I dig in. The price is reasonable for what you get. The serving size is very generous and will fill you up. The food itself is pretty easy to digest and light, theres just a lot of it.

Raku,4,I wouldve given this place 5 stars. I usually dont even like udon but its actually really good here. The noodles taste super fresh and light yet flavorful. BUT the server messed up my order and I ended up with the jaja which was slightly spicier and saltier than I was in the mood for. AND she forgot to put in the order for the mackerel sushi so we ended up having to wait longer for that after we asked about it. My sister got the wagyu beef udon which was so light and tender but amazing! Will definitely come back to try more...

Raku,3,"Recently, I had lunch with my mother and my mother s friend s family in Raku. We were 5, and it was the first time for us to eat in Raku. We all had the noodle with soup. The warm soup noodles were the best choice because it was a cold day. The texture of the noodles was incredible. I have never eaten the noodles with this chewy texture. What a soup base it is! The warm and deep-tasted soup was delicious and made my stomach comfortable. So, I could give five stars for the food. However, I would rate the service only one star. When my mother and I arrived, the server requested us to wait outside until the rest people came. As I said previously, it was one of the coldest days. Even though my companions arrived in 15 minutes, the cold kept us frozen. I couldn t understand why we had to stay outside, though some tables were vacant. Another thing I really upset about was the server s attitude. When my mother asked if the noodles she chose came with soup, the waitress looked dismissive and said harshly, Yes. My mother told me later that she was embarrassed. It might be a  ridiculous question if this restaurant had only noodles with soup. However, not everyone knows that; especially those coming for the first time, like us, definitely don t know it. Also, the server was responsible for explaining the menu and food. All the rates of the excellent food were written off with the rude attitude of the server. I am curious why noodle soups became a soul food in Japan and Korea. In Japanese cuisine, Ramen and Udon are traditional noodle soups among Japanese cuisine. So do Kalgugsu and Janchigugsu in Korean cuisine. Compared to Western food, Korea and Japan have developed a variety of soup dishes.

One party of 2, one party of 3, and our group. The first party and our groups happened to be Korean, but the middle group wasnt. Raku immediately seated the 2nd group in line first, although the very first group wasnt even seated. The first group even had a pregnant woman, but Raku decided to prioritize the middle group first. The first group and our group was seated right in front of the opened door while the second group was seated furthur inside that was a bit warmer. The outdoor seating area was about 30% full, so I am still not sure why they seated us right in front of the door when other parties were seated in warmer section. During our meal, we just had a bad service from our server Yuki from the begining to the end. When we were seated and was ready to order, my friend gave us some homemade cookies as a holiday gift.

Yuki said we arent allowed to have outside food, so we immediately put it aside, but he was keep giving us the attitude when he took our order.After taking our order, he didnt come back to us throughout our meal to check on us.

We were told to walk around and come back at a specific time, and we chose to wait patiently aside. After waiting for about half an hour, the lady checked our names and said we should have told her that we were there, which is absolutely clueless since we were there the entire time and it was not even the time she mentioned for us to show up. It was definitely an unpleasant experience, probably the worst experience in NYC. There are plenty of good restaurants in NYC.

There are many udon restaurants in Korea with chewier and more delicious noodles. Don t bother coming all the way to New York to eat. I guess Soho is okay. But like other reviews, the female server was so bad... I showed her a picture and asked for this menu, but she said she didnt know the name and didnt know what it was lol. Why cant I see it? Then he asked me to enlarge it and he mumbled so hard that I couldnt hear him because his pronunciation was weird. He kept saying he didnt know his name. Dont you work here??? What makes me feel even worse is that the white foreigner table keeps asking, what more do you need? Is everything okay? He often asked questions in a bright tone, but did not ask questions to me or the Chinese customers behind me. Whether you come alone or in a group. (I think I asked the white man who came alone 10 times ^^) They say Asians are unfriendly because their tips are salty, so why dont they take tips at all... ^^ Why do you take them?

Raku,5,"I ve been going to Raku for around five years now. They serve the best udon in the city, with some of the best tempura to boot. What s even more impressive is that they ve maintained the same quality over the years. It s gotten to the point that, when it comes to udon cravings, it s Raku or nothing. For first timers, I highly recommend the ebiten udon to get a taste of the restaurant s style. Eat the noodles one at a time. I jokingly describe it as savory boba. The udon has a supple, bouncy texture that can only come from being freshly made in-house. Most Japanese restaurants that serve udon but not exclusively udon use the frozen stuff in supermarkets. Raku is one of the few that make their own udon. It s not only the texture of the noodles: everything else is flawless. The broth is a perfect balance of fishy, salty, and sweet. Other restaurants Americanize the broth by making it too sweet; Raku s broth is the way it should be. The tempura is light and crisp without being oily. Any excess oil is absorbed by the paper it sits on. And, they provide umeboshi as a palate cleanser in between bites in case we are starting to get tired of the bowl of noodles.

The chance of eating ramen in New York is much higher than udon, but when it comes to Japanese udon, I am fully confident that Raku is definitely the number one, and I will fight if I dont accept it. It is a relatively new second store in Soho, probably opened around 2017-2018; the space is large and bright, and it is a very comfortable dining environment. As for this old store in East Village, the small room is a bit old, but it also gives people a Japanese atmosphere. Although the udon noodles here start at NT$500-600, the portion size is no joke. You will be scared when the bowl is served. My mother almost fainted when she saw it. (Single bet x4) But in addition to the large portion, there is nothing to say about the taste. Whether you want a light or rich soup here, the ingredients in the noodles are also very sincere. What is even more must-order is definitely the fried tofu. The dough is thin and crispy, the tofu is soft and tender, and the sauce goes perfectly with it. Although the fried chicken is not bad, it pales in comparison, but I still recommend ordering a small portion.

We sought refuge from the cold weather by sitting outside the establishment under the heat lamps, but were rudely kicked out by the waitress and told to stand at the front of the restaurant. The food was incredibly disappointing. The udon noodles were thick and unappetizing, bearing no resemblance to authentic Japanese cuisine. To make matters worse, they were served with subpar crab meat that my dog wouldnt even eat, all for the outrageous price of $26. Adding insult to injury, we were told the restaurant only accepts cash, and when I informed the waiter I didnt have any, they unhelpfully told us to find our own solution. Its unacceptable that in todays day and age, a restaurant in lower New York cant keep up with modern payment methods.

I guess the Udon noodles are probably freshly handmade in the restaurant because I can see the end of the noodles have those cut edges that seemed like they were not mass produced, but handcut by using something flat like a knife instead. The soup had a very clear and fresh taste. I could say that they didn t have a lot of complicated flavors. Although they tasted simple, they tasted healthy. I was glad that the shrimp tempuras were not already put into the soup when I got it but set aside in another plate because I don t like fried things soaked in soup that are no longer crispy but wet and soft. The shrimp tempura were very good, as well. The perfect tenderness of the shrimp and the perfect crispness of the tempura breading combined together worked out very well.

Raku,5,"My group and I came on a Saturday evening around 730. We made reservations through Yelp an hour or so before we got there and ended up waiting another 30-40 mins so we got seated around 8. As there is no where to wait inside Raku as the space is very small, we just grabbed drinks at a nearby bar as it was pretty cold out. Once we got seated, we warmed up and was offered green tea for waiting 30 minutes past our reservation time so definitely a nice gesture. We ordered a few things off the menu, including the Chicken Tatsuta-age, Niku Udon, Fried Yaki Nasu, Katsu Don, and Curry Udon. I was able to take a few pictures of the food before devouring the food, but everything was just so good. The food warmed our souls on that cold night, so definitely a spot I would recommend! *Cash only and make reservations in advance!*",2020,group saturday even made reserv yelp hour end wait min seat wait insid raku space small grab drink nearbi bar pretti cold seat warm offer green tea wait minut past reserv time nice gestur order thing menu includ chicken tatsuta age niku udon fri yaki nasu katsu don curri udon pictur food devour food good food warm soul cold night spot recommend cash make reserv advanc,1,0.875

Raku,5,"Outstanding udon noodle soup. Noodles are chewy and flavorful, with a delicate complementary broth that is nuanced yet subtle. The Niku is the most popular which is beef short rib with tripe. There are generous amounts of meat. We also had the eggplant appetizer which was excellent, it has a raw quail egg on top with a spicy ground meat topping reminiscent of Chinese dan dan noodle meat. Service was friendly, very fast and efficient. For all those that complain about the service in other reviews, they probably dont understand that this is a busy place and customers should be respectful of others waiting to come in. If thats a problem for you and you want to just sit around, Id suggest you find another place to eat, or leave after eating and go to any of the hundreds of bars in the area to chat and hang out. The food is outstanding. Let others enjoy it too. Other tips: - You can check in and queue up on yelp prior to coming and it will hold a spot for you in line. - This is a CASH ONLY place. They have a hidden atm in the back but probably better to just bring cash. - There isnt a place for you to wait for your table, so plan accordingly.",2020,outstand udon noodl soup noodl chewi flavor delic complementari broth nuanc subtl niku popular beef short rib tripe gener amount meat eggplant appet excel raw quail egg top spici ground meat top reminisc chines dan dan noodl meat servic friendli fast effici complain servic review dont understand busi place custom respect wait problem sit id suggest find place eat leav eat hundr bar area chat hang food outstand enjoy tip check queue yelp prior come hold spot line cash place hidden atm back bring cash isnt place wait tabl plan,1,0.8591

But, we ordered the ankimo or the monk fish liver. The ponzu soup was great and contrasted with the rich flavor of the liver.

Raku,5,"For someone who was never a fan of udon in the past, I will say this bowl was delicious. Appetizers: We ordered two appetizers, the chicken tatsuta-age and the Ankimo (monk fish liver). To start, the chicken was incredible. The sauce was a bit spicy and a bit sour, but complemented the chicken well. The chicken was breaded to perfection and cooked perfectly. The meat was very tender and crispy at the same time. To be frank, the Ankimo was a bit average. I never really had it before and wanted to try it, but I felt it was pretty bland. With that being said, it couldve been the best monk fish liver in the world and I probably wouldnt have tasted the difference. Onto the udon! Unlike most people on Yelp, I actually got the Curry Udon with beef instead of the Niku Udon (not a big fan of tripe and a big fan of curry). The broth was delicious and you could tell they really put a lot of love in there. The noodles were incredibly stringing but silky and the same time. Easily slurp-able! The beef was pretty tender and was a good addition to the dish. And portion size? It was a massive portion size (and I think I could eat a fair amount). Because I hate myself, I drank all the broth despite increasingly alarming protests from my stomach. My friend and I both had to walk around the block a few times afterwards because we felt we were about to explode. NO regrets on downing the whole dish.

I felt deceived by their menu and asked if they could switch it out with an alternative showing that the dish was almost all onions.  They told me no and that this is vegetable tempura.

Raku,4,"Some of the best udon Ive ever had, thanks to a recommendation from the owners of Setsugekka! Originally, we were planning on hitting up Sobaya but after a delightful matcha tasting at Setsugekka, we decided to ask for recommendations of their favorite restaurants. They told us of Raku, just a block away, and we decided to be adventurous and try it. Thank goodness we did, because I was blown away at how delicious the udon noodle soup is here. Although very tempted to try the popular Niku udon here, I ultimately opted for the Gyunan udon ($17) and added a poached egg to my order. The Gyunan udon has Washugyu beef, which is a cross between angus and wagyu beef. The bowls are pretty big here, and the aroma that wafts towards you as the server places the bowl down in front of you is intoxicating. My bowl of Gyunan also came with negi, which is Japanese green onion. What really sets Raku apart is the quality of their noodles. These noodles expertly soak up every flavor of the meat and broth. Theyre neither too firm nor too chewy, and the smoothness and slightly wider width of the noodles makes it the perfect candidate for successful udon. The broth is also wonderful. Beef broths in general are some of my weaknesses, and I love how this broth was not salty nor too fatty. You can add other toppings like spicy miso pork, tempura, umeboshi, oroshi, wakame, spinach, mochi, etc. Most toppings are between a $1-6 add-on. CASH ONLY but oh so worth it. They dont take recommendations and its a very small place, so be prepared.",2018,udon ive recommend owner setsugekka origin plan hit sobaya delight matcha tast setsugekka decid recommend favorit restaur told raku block decid adventur good blown delici udon noodl soup tempt popular niku udon ultim opt gyunan udon ad poach egg order gyunan udon washugyu beef cross angu wagyu beef bowl pretti big aroma waft server place bowl front intox bowl gyunan negi japanes green onion set raku qualiti noodl noodl expertli soak flavor meat broth theyr firm chewi smooth slightli wider width noodl make perfect candid success udon broth wonder beef broth gener weak love broth salti fatti add top spici miso pork tempura umeboshi oroshi wakam spinach mochi top add cash worth dont recommend small place prepar,1,0.9786
