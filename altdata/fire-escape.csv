Forsyth Fire Escape (6-Month Residency),3,"We ordered the scallion pancake pork burrito and the queso tacos. The burrito was VERY dry and the tacos were lacking flavor. Ultimately it wasnt apparent that you would *need* to buy the sauce which was $2/ea for a tiny container (about a quarter cups worth) and that both items would be severely lackihg without the sauce. Given the price, the size, and the dryness we were pretty underwhelmed for an item we had been led to believe would be delicious.

I got there 2 hours after opening and they were already out of the pernil, so I got the chicken as a consolation. They said it would be 10 minutes but it took 30. After waiting a half hour I received a small burrito filled with dry chicken and a minuscule amount of guacamole and cheese. Completely devoid of love and way overpriced for the amount of food.

Ohh, man, what a disappointment. 1: More like a taco than a burrito - so small 2: A very limited amount of fillings, a little bit of salty burned chopped meat, and a very greasy, unfamiliar other filling. They even charged me $2 for spicy sauce on the side. Ridiculous. 3: So slow. I cant blame the guy who worked there, as he had to handle the cooking and the preparing, and the cashier. I got my so-called burrito after 15-20 min. I guess there is a potential there, but it needs to be priced much lower for the size, and they need to step up with the ingredients.

Forsyth Fire Escape (6-Month Residency),2,"I was really looking forward to trying this place as I d heard really good things not just about the amazing burrito, but the people :) I went for a late lunch on a Monday, like maybe 2pm, and there was no one in the food hall and no line, which is why I chose to go on a weekday at an off peak time. However, I wonder if the burrito might have been better during a lunch rush when the food was more fresh? The meat was sitting on the flat top grill and looked like it had been there for a while. I m also not sure how fresh the <scallion> pancake was and since there were no visible scallions in the pancake..I guess it was just a pancake. As other reviewers wrote, it was super greasy, but I don t mind grease/oily food as long as it s fresh and delicious which this was not sadly. Kind of disappointing. If you re going to go, I d recommend a time when it s a little bit busy. The people were very nice, but like also seemed bored. I d be bored too bc there s nothing to do. I m not even sure how many people work there bc when I got to the counter there was just one dude taking orders. Then I walked around and came back and asked if my food was ready, he said no, then I saw another dude walk behind the counter so I guess that was the dude who actually cooks the food? Unclear.  But ya, wanted to like it, didn t, recommend going at a time when you can make sure you get something freshly made. Also perhaps it s just not as good as it once was on the fire escape? That happens.

Forsyth Fire Escape (6-Month Residency),3,"Interesting, but far away, overhyped, and perhaps overpriced. I happened to be on the far west part of the city and got to finally try this scallion burrito I saw online elsewhere. I visited this spot inside of the Olly Olly Market (which itself isnt super easy to spot the 26th street entrance.)  There was no line when I was there midday around 1pm on a Thursday. Location and maybe price may have a bit to do with that.  It was $14, but that isnt much more than a burrito from Dos Toros these days. They try to upsell you on the sauces to get sides of them, but no thanks, since it says it comes with the sauce already in the description. I got it and took it to eat on the way out. Overall, Id agree with others that is a bit too salty.  The lemongrass sauce definitely was in there, but just in one little pocket.  It was tasty. They probably should just put more on there for the price you pay. I honestly appreciate the scallion pancake, but I dont think it adds enough flavor or texture that Id pay a premium to go here over Dos Toros.

Forsyth Fire Escape (6-Month Residency),2,"For $14, this burrito was a paltry bundle of disappointment. The meat was flavorful, but not special in and of itself. It was difficult to get through towards the end because of how dry and salty it was. The filling also had a bit of cheese and maybe (?) guac but not enough to make a difference... The scallion pancake fell flat. There was no flakiness or layering. I could barely taste the scallions, and it was incredibly oily. Overall, just a poor representation of what a scallion pancake should be. Maybe it would have tasted better with the sauce, but since they wanted to charge extra for it, I expected the burrito to be able to stand on its own. It did not. Unfortunately, overhyped and overpriced.

Only to be informed by a hand written sign that they would not be open till 5pm. This place is far off the beaten path its not worth returning to see if its any good.

Forsyth Fire Escape (6-Month Residency),3,"I was so excited to finally try the burrito as I was off on a weekday. We got there around 12:30 and probably waited in line for 15-20 minutes before ordering. I thought the burrito was really oily and heavy; it felt like a brick in my stomach. I think the concept is great but it was very heavy on the oil. Something you want to take a couple bites of but not eat the whole thing. Bodega sauce was good, but nothing special. Service was awesome! 3.5 stars.",2023,excit final burrito weekday wait line minut order thought burrito oili heavi felt brick stomach concept great heavi oil coupl bite eat thing bodega sauc good special servic awesom star,0,0.8658
