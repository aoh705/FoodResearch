I arrived, and I was greeted by the lovely manager Tina, she geared us to the bar while our table was ready, and recommended some great drinks, it was less than a 5 minute wait! When I say the eggplant and garlic appetizer was out of this world! The flavors were so unique, and just outright delicious. We then ordered the tiger prawns, which was a surprisingly large serving, topped off by the mint and cilantro cream, I was licking my fingers, after, the pot of lamb with basmati rice, felt like we were eating in someones home eatings moms cooking, topped off by delicious milk dessert, I couldnt have picked a better place to dine. The service was great, all my food arrived right after the other, the servers were so helpful describing every dish, and breaking it down for me.

She said just because she needs it. It was clear she didnt know and was just following protocol. However, a second employee piped in and said it was for covid contact tracing. That program ended in April 2022. If you are collecting personal information you need to state your intent in using it. I did not end up eating here. Very bummed and frustrated by the experience.

The Lasooni Palak app was by far the best of what we tried followed by the baingan bharta. The Gobi Angaara was ok and seemed like it wasn t cooked all the way through, seemed rushed and marinade was still raw. The Paneer Nawabi was good as well and worth a try - paneer is fresh. The paratha is a sizeable portion which was good to see. For desert I would say you can skip the pista cream it s just a pistachio custard.

The scrambled egg tadka that they add on the table was hot but the sunny side up and the green sauce that the egg was sitting on was room temp. This made the whole dish cold while eating. When we told the server that the dish was cold (just to inform them and not to get a free dish or something) she said the green sauce is stored in the fridge and then added to the plate to straight without heating it. She said she will relay this feedback to the kitchen. Not sure if that s how it s supposed to be but we were not fans of Luke warm food. We ordered chapati which came in really hot and compensated for the cold egg. Overall the experience was okay. There was spice and flavor in everything but lacking in a few areas.

Dhamaka,3,"This place was good but the price is what made me give it a 3-star rating AMBIANCE The decor was great. The restaurant itself is large and spacious. Its really hard to get a reservation here so after booking a month in advance it was great to sit at a table for two and have plenty of space to dine comfortably. Bollywood music was playing overhead and overall the place had a great vibe. SERVICE Also great! Our server was attentive and gave recommendations on the food when we asked him to help us choose between two dishes. FOOD Okay so here is where my qualm starts. The food was good. Here is the breakdown solely on flavor: Papri Chaat (3/5): The spice level was great but the papri was very strange... it was super thick and hard and difficult to eat... it didnt soak in the yogurt like it should have Prawn (4.5/5): The flavor is great. However, even though it looks quite extravagant its really only 2-3 bites of deliciousness. Paneer (3/5): The dish itself was pretty oily (similar to a few other dishes judging from other reviews) and there was strong flavors from mace and methi which could be a bit overwhelming in certain bites. Dessert (4/5): Came warm which was unique. Im used to cool desserts but I loved the burnt edges of this dessert. I could have excused the food given the excellent service and the vibes. But the price! $14 for the prawn is a bit outlandish. The dessert which was a rice pudding-esque dessert was $12. We ordered a mango lassi and it was $9 (!!?). The raita on the side is also $3. Overall, I thought the food was good. But Id rather go to somewhere in Flushing or Jackson Heights to get similar quality food at half or third the price.

Veg biryani was extremely spicy with no flavors, proportions of rice, vegetables and spices were totally off along with huge amounts of potatoes.

Dhamaka,5,"Our reviews had over 137 million views this year.  We do not get paid we just love to eat and have fun.  We really loved Dhamaka.  First time there and it was totally awesome.  The most important thing is to tell your server you know nothing of this food and they will explain it all to you so you know what to get.  Our server was Azad and he was awesome.  We ended up with the Papdi Chaat which is an app that is full a flavor and not too spicy.  For main courses we had the goat neck and the mutton (mutton is just an older sheep).  Both were fall off the bone yummy with awesome flavors we had never tasted before.  Really good.  Azad said the mutton was an 8 out of 10 hot but if you have the spicy sauce at a Mexican joint you will be ok with Dhamakas 8 out of 10.  The goat neck was a 6 out of 10 so not too spicy but really yummy.  They only have one dessert which is like a cheesecake.  It is really good but it is small so you may want to get 2 of them.  No hot drinks here but several coffee shops in the Essex Market where Dhamaka is located.  We will be back again for sure because we want to try some more of the things we saw.

( i make my own paneer too at home so I understand the cost and process). They had not even mashed the lentils and I could eat the semi cooked lentil pieces.( I do like the live tadka though) . The roti wasn t cooked properly and I could see the raw dough. I had a 5 pm appt( first customer of the day) and yet for some reason their containers in which they serve chutney was only 1/8 full( too little to share between 3 ppl). They also tried to seat us by the bathroom when literally all the tables in the room were empty. Pepper chicken was average. Baingan bharta was genuinely delicious and smokey.

Long review - Bad food, below average service and just average atmosphere. The place is called Dhamaka which in their staffs words means  Explosion . Instead of explosion of taste, it is explosion of disproportional spices in the name of Indian food. The whole food is just garam masala, garam masala and garam masala. The meats were not tender and juicy, were mostly chewy and rubbery. Lassi was literally liquid sweet cream! There is no other flavour in the food.

Dhamaka,1,"WORST RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I had a horrendous experience at dhamaka and judging by some of the other reviews, Im not the only one. The problem is not the food. It is the management and the attitude of the host. This review is specifically for the manager Tina Dholikar. Im horrified that such a acclaimed restaurant would hire someone this devoid of common courtesy and manners. We were late for our reservation by 15 minutes due to the traffic and Tina refused to seat us. It was a full restaurant and food coming in for the tables and yet she refused to seat us. We had asked for the manager at which she said that would be me, I know I dont look like it, but I am. Indeed she did not sound or look like a floor manager who knows how to talk to customers. She went on and on about how it would be disrespectful to the chef and his time and yet it was perfectly fine that we wasted 30 minutes rushing to get to our reservation. She spoke back to us three separate times. It is perfectly fine for a manager to say that they cannot accommodate a guest as they missed their reservation but there is a way to do it. Being antagonistic and rude to the customer all the while making a huge deal blaming them for being late is not the way. We then asked if she had a business card in case we needed to get in touch with the owner, she replied sorry, we dont like to cut trees. I then said those are basic marketing materials to which she replied we are looking for a certain type of diner and are not trying to market our restaurant to everyone. Im sorry, but this is beyond acceptable and she would be fired on the spot at any other decent restaurant. I get that your restaurant is enjoying good reviews now, but having horrible staff like this really makes your restaurant look very undesirable. There are a million restaurants in NYC and no one needs to come to dhamaka. We ended up going to a wonderful Indian spot that did accommodate us and was very courteous. We will be sending everyone there. I would really prefer to not waste my precious holiday time writing a review, but it was beyond rude and sorry, but awful attitude like this will only beget aa very negative reputation.

Dhamaka,1,"I had a terrible experience at Dhamaka earlier this week and am noticing that all the recent reviewers are noting similar experiences. From my observations, it seems there is a really poor manager whose complete lack of professionalism is impacting other staff and the overall service. The protein in one of our dishes was inedible. I ve had this dish previously at Dhamaka and ordered it again because I really enjoyed it. Since we couldn t eat the dish, we mentioned it to our server (who seemed new and really uncomfortable and uncertain throughout the entire visit, even before this point). The server went to relay our feedback to management and then came back to the table and inexplicably started arguing with us, telling us the dish was fine. We again politely explained that the sauce was flavorful but the protein was off and we couldn t eat any of it (it was basically just bones, no meat, and the tiny shreds of chicken were either severely overcooked, or undercooked, we couldn t even tell because it didn t resemble chicken in any capacity). After another back and forth of her going to speak to the manager, and a long awkward pause where no solution or apology was offered (the normal response at a restaurant of this caliber would be to replace the dish with something else, comp a glass of wine, offer us dessert .something/anything other than being argumentative), we reiterated our feedback and the server again began arguing that the dish was fine. As our plates were being cleared, the server inexplicably asked if we d like the food boxed to take home. No, no thanks. At this point, we asked that the dish be removed from our bill, because it was clear that Dhamaka had no interest in rectifying the situation. The sever had to ask the manager, and then came back and told us there was nothing that could be done since we had eaten the food.

Dhamaka,2,"Dhamaka used to be our favorite Indian restaurant in the city. They changed the menu in April of this year and so disappointed in those changes. Came here last night to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. Our favorite dish was always the Goat Neck Biryani ($33). With the new menu changes, they switched our Goat Briyani ($33) to Lamb Biryani (Now $75!!). The dishs price more than doubled even though Lamb is cheaper than Goat. We decided to try something new and ordered the Champaran Meat. The main ingredient in this dish was a whole garlic. The dish unfortunately was over powered by the garlic and we could not taste the Indian spices we hoped for to compliment the garlic. Overall disappointed with these changes and will have to look for a new place to get goat biryani",2023,dhamaka favorit indian restaur citi chang menu april year disappoint night celebr boyfriend birthday favorit dish goat neck biryani menu switch goat briyani lamb biryani dish price doubl lamb cheaper goat decid order champaran meat main ingredi dish garlic dish power garlic tast indian spice hope compliment garlic disappoint place goat biryani,-1,0.1531

They have a lamb chuck cooked, and when they open up the pot, it literally slides off the bone. The Kolambi Ani Kekda was good but definitely will feel more seafood like. So if youre looking for a better approach for seafood can go with this type of rice. If not I wouldnt recommend it since it will be an explosion of seafood taste. The drinks I would probably say are on the more expensive side but I feel like its only good to order for the experience of trying out their alcoholic mixtures being different. Is it worth over $20 per drink? I dont think so. Maybe if it was like $15 like majority places, Id consider it. It was a great overall experience.

Dhamaka misunderstands that equation and the food is unapologetically fiery. But just that. We had the Potato Chaat, Afghani Chicken w/ Parathas, and the Nalli Biriyani. We topped the meal with Rabdi. The only saving grace were the parathas  crispy, buttery, and delightful! The Afghani Chicken was flavorful but a far-fetched interpretation of the OG dish.  At $70+ the Nalli Biriyani was all about the pageantry  massive sealed claypot, 8inch long shank, and the spectacle of wispy steam as the server removes the lid at the table! It was so fiery that none of the other flavors that are so typical of a well-made biriyani, came through. The lamb shank was such a great idea but the dish is very poorly executed.

In my visit, several items stood out: Aloo Dhamaka, Mirchi pakora, Bombay duck (actually a fish), lamb chaap, methi na gota all very tasty and even unique. I still think the paneer is possibly the best Ive had anywhere. The lamb shank biriyani is amazing and the quantity of meat is substantial. Theres a lot of flavor depth and multi-layeredness. Honestly, this paired with two appetizers could probably feed a group of 4. Lasooni lobster had great flavor but a bit too salty for my taste. The Nagaland pork - you really have to like pork belly to get into this one. My tablemates loved this dish but personally, it wasnt for me.

Had Aloo Dhamaka (girlfriends favorite among these), Lasooni Lobster (my fav, prepare for butter flavor intensity), Baingan Bharta (eggplant flavored by charcoal), paratha, and Saada Paan cocktail. Bartender was great about 1) explaining the new menu to us. 2) when I asked about the Chaas mocktail, he let me try a sample - - I disliked it, and appreciated the sample! 3) gave us an extra paratha when he said the first looked burnt. 4) staff offered sample tasters (eg the size of an ice cream parlor sample) of the desserts, which we appreciated. We heard a comment from one staff member (management?) who criticized the bartender for not pushing more cocktails on customers, which made us a little uncomfortable. As in 2021, spicy flavors were intense, but this time it didnt distract me in the way it had then. Unsure if the difference was my mental preparedness or the food. ___ Oct 2021 By group consensus, the winners of the night were the biryani and lasooni prawns. Almost every item was intensely spiced (not merely capsaicin spice), which had me mixed between loving it and distracted by the overwhelming intensities that stayed in my mouth. Service was attentive, and also fun with presentations/explanations for several of the items.

As someone who grew up with chili peppers as a staple, I can tolerate the spiciness, but if you re not used to heat then order the milder items on the menu. Out of the several times I dined here, the biryani was the only disappointing dish. It s good, but there are so many better items on the menu that I regretted not getting something else. The dessert is unique, like a Basque burnt cheesecake but gooey and slightly savory. All that dairy helps get rid of the heat on your tongue before you leave the restaurant. I have a suspicion that the waitstaff are trained to make customers order more than needed. Portion sizes are huge.

Additionally, the grilled items all had the same sauce on them, which should have been made clear when ordering. The space is fine although difficult for hearing.

Dhamaka,5,"Unapologetically Lives Up To The Hype Came here to celebrate a birthday recently and the food did not disappoint. We had two appetizers, two entrees and a side order of the chapatis and a 1947 beer which came out to a total of $180 including a 20% gratuity. The pros: Both appetizers were ample and enough for four people. We had the Ragda Pattice a potato patty, white pea, green chili   and the Ajwani Paneer Tikka a house-made paneer, garam masala which we had to stop eating to leave room for our main course. The entree portions were even more generous in size and we realized we ordered way too much food.  The Goat Neck Dum Biryani a braised goat neck, Basmati rice, saffron was delicious with the right amount of heat.  The Lamb Shank Nihari with black cardamom, fried onion, tomato come in a medium sized stainless steel pot and reminded me of my mother s cooking.  This dish was spicier that the goat. An order of chapatis was not enough to accompany this dish and a side of basmati rice would be ideal. Twenty minutes into the meal we realized we had ordered enough for four people.  Noted for next time. The waitstaff is attentive but not overbearing.  They promptly refilled the glasses of water whenever it was low - essential with the spice level of some of the dishes. Cons: it s loud!  Every seat inside and out was occupied on a cold November evening at 7 pm so the noise level was loud to begin with and adding the pounding soundtrack of bhangra and other Bollywood tracks didn t help. We had the unfortunate luck of being two seats away from a party of six which included one woman who was especially loud throughout the entire meal - at several points we thought she was in distress or about to start an altercation but no, just an extremely loud person unaware of the social mores of eating at a restaurant. Our seat was adjacent to the half wall leading to the lone restroom so we always had either the open door or a persona waiting in line in our peripheral vision.  Perhaps they can add a curtain or extend the wall to ensure that lucky diner in this seat has a better experience. The reservation process is still a pain (while democratic). We had to book about a month and a half ahead of time by waiting for midnight when the spots become open by hitting refresh on the browser and having a quick trigger finger.

The dishes were way way way way too salty. Fortunately the spices were pungent enough that I was able to discern flavors other than saltiness. Our group however was really looking for heat, not just spiciness, and we got none of that. Food (good to bad): Tabak Maaz - So fatty and tender. Easily my favorite. Goat Neck Biryani - Very generous with the meat. I ate so much of the rice because it was the only dish other than the paneer that wasnt too salty. Champaran Meat - Not amazing, but far better than the non-meat dishes. Mango Lassi - This was straight up mango puree. Lasooni Prawns - The seasoning overpowered the flavor of the prawns, to the point it really didnt matter what protein it was. Papdi Chaat - This yogurt-wafers combo had to be an acquired taste, and I hadnt acquired it yet. I couldnt see the pomegranate seeds as more than an inconvenience.

We got 5 apps/smaller plates and 2 entrees. The stand outs where the Gooda Kapoora, Tabak Maaz, and Lasooni Prawns. Got the Papdi Chaat and Radga Patrice as well which were both amazing combinations of flavor (also both vegetarian options). For mains we got the Goat Neck Dum Biryani and Murgh Kofta which were both very good as well.  The food was more than enough for the 3 of us and ended up taking some home.

Thank you for trying waiter but I really wanted to try your kabab since its a dish that I travel outside of my borough once a month for at another location.

I finished one (1) dish and had to take the rest back to my hotel room, which wasn t ideal since I was leaving the next day and wouldn t have time to eat it all. So I just kind of feel like he deliberately upcharged me. I even at the end said,  It was way too much food!  When he asked how it was and he didn t respond at all lol. I also had a weirdly long wait between my apps and entree with no explanation, even though he had said the entree was on its way when it didn t actually arrive until 20-30 minutes later. So idk.

Dhamaka,5,"I ve been to Dhamaka on three occasions now so I ll summarize my most recent visit, as well as others that I enjoyed during my previous visits. Not mentioned below (due to character limit) are the grilled paneer and the Ragda Pattice (both great). I ve had most of the grilled menu at this point and it s all delicious. Papdi chaat - A beautiful medley of yogurt, chili-cilantro hari chutney, tamarind, and chaat masala with a pop of pomegranate to mix things up a bit. And, of course, that signature dhamaka spice. Every bite is a flavor explosion. If you haven t had chaat before, I d recommend this dish over any other. My favorite and they do it perfectly! Gurda kapoora - Testicles and kidneys! And chilies! Spicccyyyyy. And buttery. All in a rich, fragrant, fiery tomato gravy. Not for the faint of heart and not for the average eater. But get past your reticence, soak all that up in some crispy and buttery pav (bread roll), and you have yourself a wonderful concoction reminiscent of your favorite hearty chili. If you re lucky enough to come on a night when this isn t sold out (seriously), I highly recommend adding this to your order. Paplet Fry - if you hadn t guessed yet, I m Indian. But My household did not do seafood outside of a tilapia fillet fry every so often. So when I get a chance to experience the way that my people do seafood, I m always appreciative of the experience. The seasoning on this dish is perfect granting a tangy and flavorful playfulness that bounces off the crispness of the fish wonderfully. Add to that some pickled red onions and cilantro-chili chutney if you must, I honestly felt it didn t need anything else. (Probably my Atlanta side telling me that I miss fried fish in the south). Goat Belly Seekh - I ve had plenty of seekh kabobs but this one is truly unique. Their means of grilling this spicy concoction? Wrapping it in wood to create a convection oven effect and letting it soak in the juices that would otherwise fall out if baked in such a manner. Genius. We also had a brief conversation with Chef Pandya before our dinner, who recommended this as his favorite item. So we ordered 3. Fresh roti! They asked so I will never turn it down. Not the best roti I ever had but happy to have it all the same. Lamb Shank Nihari - Y all. So many amazing plates during this visit, and so many things that I d absolutely get again, but this was tonight s standout. I make a damn good nihari at home, so my standards are high, and of course, I m always looking to compare. There are components that you need to get correct in order to do this dish right I ve never had lamb in a nihari so I was curious how the changeup would sit with me. It sat just fine. Right off the bat (bone), the lamb melted into the gravy. Meat, check. Thickness and consistency, check. Spice, check check check (Chef Pandya never disappoints in spice). And it all comes together beautifully. You can have nihari at home 2/3x a week and still come here and feel like you re getting something different. But something that really holds true to the essence of what a nihari should be. A+ dish. Goat Neck Dum Biryani. We had some Hyderabadis in our party so we tend to be particular when it comes to a good biryani. Personally, I felt it held up, but it didn t wow me. But others in our party loved it, and one even said it s as good as any Hyderabadi biryani that he s had. One unique component: there is a layer of spice (because of course there is) on the dum lid. I recommend using this as your carb-vessel with all other dishes. You re welcome. Champaran meat - this was a new dish for me, I d never heard of it or tried it. If you love garlic (let s be honest, who doesn t), this is the dish for you. A full head of garlic was the first thing I caught in my roti -  didn t realize that until my second bite but I wasn t at all mad about it. The meat is tender and altogether this is a tasty dish, recommended by Chef Pandya as well. My thoughts? Too many things I love on this menu, and too many things I ve yet to try for me to come back to this one.",2023,ve dhamaka occas ll summar recent visit enjoy previou visit mention due charact limit grill paneer ragda pattic great ve grill menu point delici papdi chaat beauti medley yogurt chili cilantro hari chutney tamarind chaat masala pop pomegran mix thing bit signatur dhamaka spice bite flavor explos haven chaat recommend dish favorit perfectli gurda kapoora testicl kidney chili spicccyyyyi butteri rich fragrant fieri tomato gravi faint heart averag eater past retic soak crispi butteri pav bread roll wonder concoct reminisc favorit hearti chili lucki night isn sold highli recommend ad order paplet fri hadn guess indian household seafood tilapia fillet fri chanc experi peopl seafood appreci experi season dish perfect grant tangi flavor play bounc crisp fish wonder add pickl red onion cilantro chili chutney honestli felt didn atlanta side tell miss fri fish south goat belli seekh ve plenti seekh kabob uniqu mean grill spici concoct wrap wood creat convect oven effect let soak juic fall bake manner geniu convers chef pandya dinner recommend favorit item order fresh roti ask turn roti happi lamb shank nihari amaz plate visit thing absolut tonight standout make damn good nihari home standard high compar compon correct order dish ve lamb nihari curiou changeup sit sat fine bat bone lamb melt gravi meat check thick consist check spice check check check chef pandya disappoint spice beauti nihari home week feel hold true essenc nihari dish goat neck dum biryani hyderabadi parti tend good biryani person felt held didn wow parti love good hyderabadi biryani uniqu compon layer spice dum lid recommend carb vessel dish champaran meat dish heard love garlic honest doesn dish full head garlic thing caught roti didn realiz bite wasn mad meat tender altogeth tasti dish recommend chef pandya thought thing love menu thing ve back,1,0.9951

We chatted with the host and since it was our first time in the market, she recommended we look around and see the bars downstairs. We took the look around and decided to come back up to Dhamaka to eat. We asked to put our name on the wait list and went back downstairs to have a drink until our table was ready. Our table was now ready, and my boyfriend went up to retrieve our table while I closed out the bill at the bar downstairs. He then called me because he said he was not allowed to sit until I was present. Now mind you, the host saw he and I together twice. So why could he not get sat? Even if policy is that all guest must be present to sit down, to me a table for a party of 2 is the same size as if 1 person came in to dine. Now if we said 4 people and they only saw 2, the policy makes sense, but that was not the case. We were seated and the woman who sat us proceeded to say we only have an hour and fifteen minutes because we were walk-ins. Cool, no problem. Now our server comes and repeats the same thing the woman said who sat us. I was a bit irritated at this point because I felt rushed. He back within less than 2 minutes and asked if we ready. Mind you it s our first time there, so no, I am not ready and asks him  Can we have a minute . He comes back, I have questions about the menu, and he answers them and now everything seems to fine. He said the food would take about 30 minutes to come out because its fresh and it actually came out sooner, so my boyfriend and I were happy. We finished our delicious meal, paid for it, and went to the bathroom before we left the premises. My boyfriend is looking for the bathroom and the bartender chimes in and says  Can I help you . My boyfriend replies  we just ate here and are looking for the bathroom . He then says  you have to go downstairs  Mind you we had just finished our meal at the establishment. At this point I am even more irritated because how dare this man not listen to my boyfriend when he specifically said we just ate here and are looking for the bathroom. One of the hosts then makes eye contact with the bartender as if it is okay for us to proceed. That honestly made me upset because he didn t even ask questions and wanted to send us somewhere else far from the bathroom that was in close proximity to where we were standing.

We were able to order some appetizers and cocktails from the bar. One of the things that I would like to mention is the great customer service from the hostess, the bartenders and the waiters everyone was very accommodating, friendly and attentive. Kudos to William and Raj who recommended dishes and to our bartender that offered us some mango juice to calm the spiciness from the tiger prawn We ordered Fried Fish, Goat Belly Seekh, Tiger Prawns, Tabak Maaz. Every single dish was phenomenal. The fish  tasted fresh, and the ribs were tender, juicy and tasty. Special commendation on the tiger prawn, it was spicy but the flavor was super delicious.

Dhamaka,5,"To note: this review is specifically for the Rajasthani Khargosh (rabbit dish). I ve been trying for some time to get the ever elusive rabbit dish so I was so excited to finally reserve it a month before my reservation for a prime weekend time. It made it hard to wait for that long but it surely didn t disappoint. This dish is truly a one of kind experience. Yes, not just a meal, but an entire experience. Our waitress (Lila) and the story she told about the dish and the restaurant really took this to another level. The restaurant is labeled as unapologetic Indian, which is a great way to describe how this dish came to be. You can read all about the backstory elsewhere, but it makes it feel special to understand everything that goes into this. The rabbit itself is spectacular, cooked in a sealed pot after making a trip from upstate New York days earlier and then marinating for some time. It s so tender and just goes perfectly with whatever sauce it s cooked in. It s spicy for sure - you know that going in and you start to notice that immediately. The rabbit itself is served whole, head, organs, and everything else. For those of you who are adventurous like me, I highly recommend try every piece of this animal. It s part of what makes it so special, given that most foods we eat aren t prepared whole like this (besides fish). On the side, they provide some bread to dip into any of the array of options, which included an incredible lentil dish and a spicy potato side. Those lentils were maybe the best I ve had and complement the other dishes well (mostly because they provide some relief from the spice). Don t worry, they also give you a bit of yogurt and rice in case the lentils aren t enough to cool your mouth. Lila (waitress) really made this meal additionally special so I definitely want to make sure she gets the shoutout. Not only was she very attentive, but she was clearly enjoying our experience and entertained our questions, curiosity, and general wackiness of three 20-somethings out at dinner. I m really glad that a place like this exists to push the boundaries on cuisine by introducing truly unique dishes. I really enjoyed their other restaurant Adda (Long Island City) when I went a few years ago and consistently enjoy (read: love) my constant trips to Angel (Jackson Heights), which is helmed by a former Adda chef.

Dhamaka,3,"It seems that they ve done a solid job of PR because I find it hard to reconcile reviews from food critics with my real life experience. Food falls flat on flavor whilst still being a slap in your face with heat. My hunch is that many of the reviewers are mistaking heat for flavor. Heads up: The menu is limited for vegetarians and appetizers are better than mains. We got papdi chat and ragda pattice for apps. Ragda pattice was excellent and papdi chat was good but not true to the Punjabi style papdi chat. Anyhow, whatever it was, it was good. For mains, we got the paneer methi dish with paratha. The paratha again wasn t authentically Punjabi and had a processed/pre-made taste. The paneer was incredibly fresh but the methi leaves needed to be cooked more. The gravy was heavy on cinnamon (found a 5 inch cinnamon bark) and had an unpleasant bitter taste from the uncooked methi. The flavor profile absolutely needs more balancing and the recipe needs more cooking time. Cocktails are great! Overall, over-priced for what it is given that the restaurant is just an area sectioned off in a food hall. Meat eaters will likely have a better experience with food here. Lots of choices. I ve tried Adda, Dhamaka and Rowdy Rooster and it seems that unapologetic foods does street eats and chaat well but not mains and curries. I find them over-hyped for this reason.

I paid almost $200 for a meal for a 2 people and left hungry. Everything is extremely oily and spicy and I was told that there was no way I could indicate my food s spicy level because the kitchen is too  unapologetically Indian . Trust me, I love my food spicy, but my stomach is hurting from so much spicy! The portions were also VERY small. Stick to your local Indian spot.

Take note, me and my partner are both Asian and love spicy food. We also live in Jackson Heights (Queens, NY) which have a great Indian Food scene so we are really familiar with Indian food. But we werent really able to tolerate the spice level of every dish in this restaurant. For the price we pay we are really really disappointed. We werent able to finish any dish. WE LEFT STARVING AF.

Paap Di Chaat - a great appetizer that is sweet and sour with a nice crunch to it 3. Dessert - the cheesecake like texture is out of this world. The aroma of the dish was so earthy. Never had a dessert like this before. We re definitely going to come back and try more dishes.

After a doctors appointment we managed to show up on time, because it was a friendly team who had opened another restaurant in the city! We were seated within 15 minutes by an extremely helpful and attentive team. It was 4 adults and our 2 year old who was seated in his very comfortable high chair. What we liked: the appetizers, cocktails, and service was very nice. Very flavorful, packed with taste and punch! Most cocktails cost $18 and Paan-E-Bahar + City Harvest was a winner. If you like the flavor of Paan, this drink is packed with that taste! Appetizers are priced well, Bharela Marcha (3 pcs) ($9) and Ajwani Paneer Tikka - 2 pieces ($13) were absolutely delicious. The Paneer was very fresh and definitely felt like homemade! What we did not like: Pricing! I understand its Delancey street, but its definitely not that expensive to rent a shared space. Food is good, but some of the entrees are a little too expensive. $29 for a veggie pulao is a bit much, no matter how much you jazz it up with a super star chef level with some super flavored mix is masalas. Served in a nice mini pressure cooker the dish looks very inviting and is tasty. Goat Neck Dum Biryani at $39 comes in a relatively large portion which was shared by 3 people. I wish the portion size is reduced and the price, so we couldve tried a few other mains which we couldnt. One thing that definitely stands out is they dont ask for desired spice level, and the spice level is absolutely perfect (slightly on the spicier side). We absolutely loved the food, so Chintan - well done again! There was also one point in time in the evening where the music was very loud for us to have conversations.

Went here just as NYC was reopening in April and was sooooooooper happy with the service and shout out the owner for being a gentleman and scholar making this an experience to remember. Found this place courtesy of eater nyc. They were right to put it on their new hotness list. We started with the Ragda Pattice (crispy potato) which was delicious, crispy, well seasoned and the perfect spice level.  We then had Bharela Marcha (stuffed sweet peppers) which was the most surprising and best vegetarian bite of the night.   The best carnivore bite of the night was the Tabak Maaz (lamb ribs).  I love ribs and these are in my top 3 ribs in the world. For the mains I had the original scotch egg (Murgh Kofta, yet another thing my British fore-bearers stole from India).  It was amazeballz.

Next and I would say the most traditionally made, was the succulent Champaran Meat(with a whole baked garlic) and we paired it perfectly with the Parathas, which was so flaky and crispy and oozing with ghee.

Dhamaka,1,"Unimpressive. Pretentious. Expensive. I have a very high bar for Indian food. From authentic true to its roots dishes, to brave fusions that stretch the rich culinary heritage of India while taking creative leaps. When we looked at the menu at Dhamaka it had the makings of a promising hip Indian restaurant that seemed to balance both. The reality was sadly far from it. We ordered plenty of food. With each dish being regrettably worse than the other. The fish and the lamb chops are just doused in spice mix that makes you wonder if it was the spice mix that was main dish being served with protein as an accompaniment. The oil in the biryani left a horrible after taste. The kind that sticks to roof of your mouth and leaves you feeling gassy later. The chicken can only be taken down with the chutney and pickled onion they give on the side. The chicken kofta is overpowered by the mustard in the curry and might I tell you feels terribly undone to begin with. The masala in kofta seemed to be uncooked - could have spent some time being sauteed to remove the raw taste of what I m sure is the same spice mix. If you take a closer look at the photos on Google Maps or the dishes in person the overpowering use of this spice mix will seem evident. Every dish either garnished by it or cooked with it. Which is probably why all their dishes seem to lack any kind of structure and depth. Like a young grad who left home from India to study in the US, recreating the flavors of home, with the overbearing use of this spice mix. There is one stand out dish that deserves five whole stars on its own. This is the only dessert the restaurant serves -  Chenna Poda  from the humble lands of Nayagarh, Odisha in India. Everything about this dish makes me yearn for what this restaurant could have been. Everything about this dessert is the promise and potential this restaurant has but is clearly too self occupied pretending to be something it cannot to notice. The simplicity of the dish, the humility of the clay bowls and banana leaf it s served in, and the regal taste for what very much is a village treat. Alas, the only dish I d come back to this restaurant for.

I havent been so excited about a restaurant since the first tiny Mission Chinese opened on Orchard St. Everything we had was delicious, boldly spiced but not painfully hot, perfectly cooked, and unique enough to stand out on the table. The potato patty was one of our favorites, with a fruity mango(?) based sauce that deftly balanced heat and sweet. The goat belly from the grills was also outstanding - like a loosely packed sausage studded with bright herbs and a perfect amount of fat. But the best was the fried fish loaded with cumin and crunchy as could be, with addictive picked red onion on the side. The unctuous lamb ribs and the pig face with its smoky char were also great. I love how brave they are with their protein choices, as I love goat, lamb and offal, but I have to say I would skip the kidney and testicle stew next time.

We were fortunate to have an opportunity to experience the exceptional cuisine and warm hospitality of Chef Chintan and his team. - Loved the Joshila cocktail - perfect blend of mezcal, green chili & passion fruit. Paan-E-Bahar could benefit from some more ginger liquer. - Each regional dish was perfectly executed, and authentic in its flavors. We covered quite a spectrum: Bharela Marcha (Gujarat), Paplet (Mumbai/Goa), Doh Khleh (Meghalaya), Goat Belly Seekh, Champaran Mutton (Bihar), Macher Jhol (Bengal), and Chena Poda (Odisha). - Champaran Mutton stood out as the signature dish. Marinated for 24 hrs, and slow cooked in an earthen pot for 4 hrs. We had always thought of goat meat as mutton, but Chef Chintan was very kind to explain to us that mutton is from a 3 yr old sheep. With the decline of wool industry, older sheep are hard to find - so the mutton is sourced from Arizona and flown in fresh. It was cooked beautifully - with the smoky flavor of mustard oil, well balanced with the sweetness of a whole bulb of garlic. Dhamaka has arrived with a bang! We would highly recommend Dhamaka to anyone who wants to experience the amazing flavors that regional Indian cuisine has to offer.
