There were only 4 people ahead of me, but as I was waiting, the line did get longer behind me. The cafe people seemed aggravated that the cafe patrons were blocking the doorway, which I could understand if they actually had customers coming in; but there was literally no one going to the cafe the whole time I was there; so the rudeness seemed unnecessary. Ended up getting the monthly special - the oui love oishii supreme. The strawberry and yuzu flavors sounded interesting; but the yuzu jam-like filling actually didnt work for me with this pastry. The strawberry frosting on top actually did work, and I wished there was more of this and less of the yuzu stuff. The pastry itself as nice a flaky.

No line which was amazing! I wouldn t wait longer than 15 min, especially in the cold. The pistachio one had hints of extract, which I m not too big a fan of. The chocolate had an almost alcoholic like flavor filling, with basically dark chocolate icing on top. The croissant outer shell was amazing, I honestly think that alone is worth trying. Very very crispy and flakey. Overall, however I probably wouldn t go out of my way again.

The croissants can run out, so come soon after they are baked (which is apparently at 8am, 12pm, and 4pm). We got in line at 1:30,am and got our croissants at 2pm.

The 3 flavors available at the time: chocolate, pistachio, and strawberry. I tried the pistachio one. It was filled with pistachio cream, very sweet, flaky, and good enough portion for one person. While it was easy to procure a croissant, and find a seat, the price point wasn t enticing. One croissant costed $10.34 (with tax), which is not at all cheap or common for a croissant. Also tried their Mocha with plant based milk, which costed an additional $9 (with tax).

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,3,"Here is the nitty-gritty of my thoughts: 1. Is it Worth the hype? No. Even though I enjoyed it, $10 for a pastry is overpriced. You pay for the aesthetics. I can t deny this vday limited supreme is cuter than their regular ones. The croissant is huge - share one with your friend so you pay $5 each, girl math. Oishii Berry is expensive, so you can also convince yourself paying more for good strawberries. 2. How long did I wait? 10 mins before they started selling the last batch (4pm) on a Friday. Don t waste your time if the line is too long. If you have never tried Lafayette s viral croissants and been wanting to try for the hell of it, go ahead. The hype is dying down. You never go wrong with Oishii Berry, and this collab is 100% instagrammable. Oui Love Oishii Supreme We read many bad reviews about their supremes, but this February special went beyond our expectations. The pink white chocolate top glaze was overly sweet so we scraped it off. The two Koyo berries were good but much smaller irl. Mediocre croissant - it was neither buttery nor flaky, perhaps that s how their supreme maintains the perfectly round shape. Yuzu creme was right up my alley, very creamy and citrusy; while the Koyo berry compote tasted fresh and natural, unlike some sickly sweet jam with artificial flavoring. The two components were good seperately but didn t really complement with one another.",2024,nitti gritti thought worth hype enjoy pastri overpr pay aesthet deni vday limit suprem cuter regular croissant huge share friend pay girl math oishii berri expens convinc pay good strawberri long wait min start sell batch pm friday don wast time line long lafayett viral croissant want hell ahead hype die wrong oishii berri collab instagramm oui love oishii suprem read bad review suprem februari special expect pink white chocol top glaze overli sweet scrape koyo berri good smaller irl mediocr croissant butteri flaki suprem maintain perfectli round shape yuzu creme alley creami citrusi koyo berri compot tast fresh natur unlik sickli sweet jam artifici flavor compon good seper didn complement,0,0.9674

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,5,"Surprisingly one of the best croissants I ve had despite the social media hype (a huge red flag). Is it worth standing in line for an hour? No, absolutely not. But I passed by it in the morning and saw a very short line, so I had to try it out, and it was fully worth the short wait. The circular shape is more than a gimmick. It exposes all the layers equally to the hot air in the oven, resulting in an even crunch. The crispy shell and velvety filling complemented each other. The custard was on the sweeter side, but it became the right amount of sweetness with the plain croissant dough. Overall, highly recommended as long as the line is very short.",2023,surprisingli croissant ve social media hype huge red flag worth stand line hour absolut pass morn short line fulli worth short wait circular shape gimmick expos layer equal hot air oven result crunch crispi shell velveti fill complement custard sweeter side amount sweet plain croissant dough highli recommend long line short,1,0.8625

Admittedly, it was an unconventional choice for me, but it proved to be a revelation. The buttery layers melded harmoniously with the rich, nutty pistachio, elevating this to the pinnacle of croissant desserts I ve ever savored. Following this act was the cinnamon cronut, which was very good in its own right, with its sweet, spiced layers offering a satisfying crunch. However, it was overshadowed by the sheer excellence of the croissant wheel.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,1,"Visiting this bakery was a painfully disappointing experience. The service provided was deplorable, characterized by staff who seemed to wear their rudeness as a badge of honor. Simple amenities like napkins were noticeably absent from the tables, leaving guests scrambling and helpless in maintaining a clean and enjoyable dining atmosphere. Finding the restroom turned into an unintentional game of hide and seek, with zero signage to guide the way and staff too discourteous to assist. When inquiring about the location, the response received was not directions but instead, an undeserved bout of yelling. Moreover, the glaring absence of service personnel on the floor meant that getting assistance or asking questions turned into a daunting challenge. The only semblance of kindness and professionalism could be traced back to the bar staff, who unfortunately seemed overwhelmed and unable to manage the floor. My experience reached its nadir when I, unable to locate a trash receptacle and finding no staff to assist, left my leftovers on a waiters station. This action was met with public humiliation as a waiter - a rude, middle-aged, heavyset man - decided the appropriate response was to yell across the cafe, attracting the unwanted attention of all present. Though I apologized, the sting of embarrassment and the bitter taste of regret lingered far longer than it should have. Date & hour of visit: 3 Oct, 10:00 AM. This bakery is a minefield of unprofessionalism and a gallery of how-not-to-treat-customers. If being treated like refuse is on your agenda, by all means, step in. Otherwise, consider any and all alternatives as a better choice for your patronage. This establishment not only failed to meet the basic standards of hospitality but seemed to actively disdain them. Consider yourself warned.",2023,visit bakeri pain disappoint experi servic provid deplor character staff wear rude badg honor simpl amen napkin notic absent tabl leav guest scrambl helpless maintain clean enjoy dine atmospher find restroom turn unintent game hide seek signag guid staff discourt assist inquir locat respons receiv direct undeserv bout yell glare absenc servic personnel floor meant assist question turn daunt challeng semblanc kind profession trace back bar staff overwhelm unabl manag floor experi reach nadir unabl locat trash receptacl find staff assist left leftov waiter station action met public humili waiter rude middl age heavyset man decid respons yell cafe attract unwant attent present apolog sting embarrass bitter tast regret linger longer date hour visit oct bakeri minefield unprofession galleri treat custom treat refus agenda mean step altern choic patronag establish fail meet basic standard hospit activ disdain warn,-1,-0.8934

Disgusting and late food, mid atmosphere, and rude understaffed servers that made an overall insulting and humiliating experience for my entire family that ruined our trip to NYC this Summer. Here are the details. The Asian girl server was so rude taking our order, and had us wait for about an hour until we checked with another server (bc she never came to check on us), just to hear that our order was never put in. We were so mad but we re-ordered since we wanted to try the Benedict. And about ten minutes later, the manager told us that the Kitchen used all of the Hollandaise sauce for the day and that we have to put in a different order. Almost an hour after we arrived at the place, we ordered medium well steak and rare tuna salad. Which we waited for ANOTHER HOUR. We waited for a total of two hours waiting for one of the worst steaks I ve ever had   too salty, all I taste is pepper salt, red as rare, tasteless and chewy to the point where my jaw ached. Got there at 10:30, left at about 1:20 with a day ruined. And the worst part is that the manager put the bill on the house, yet, never got a single apology from the Asian server that took our order in the first place, and all the other staff who gave us an attitude and words saying  don t bother since we are paying , as well as a Spanish worker who laughed at us and mocked us when we were leaving the restaurant with disappointment. Servers don t have their designated table sections, which means we had to talk to over five servers before getting our disappointing first food after two hours.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,1,"Despite the considerable efforts the business owner/manager put into creating a pleasant dining experience, our visit to this cafe was unfortunately marred by the behavior of one particular server. Our encounter with Jose, our assigned waiter, left much to be desired in terms of courtesy and professionalism. From the onset, Jose interrupted our initial waitress, who was already attending to our table, only to embark on an unsolicited lecture about the distinctions between still and tap water after a simple request for water. Such unnecessary condescension left a negative impression. Moreover, when my mother inquired about the various types of croissants available, Jose responded by curtly suggesting she approach the bakery stand and ask the question herself. A more accommodating response could have involved acknowledging the available options, such as chocolate, pistachio, and traditional, while advising her to verify their availability at the bakery due to high demand. Unfortunately, his response lacked tact and carried an undertone of insolence. A similar encounter unfolded when my father sought clarification on the relative strength of the latte compared to the cortado. Jose responded with a sarcastic smile and uncalled-for rudeness, generating an atmosphere that made us feel somewhat guilty for not being well-versed in coffee intricacies. It is disheartening that the excellent potential of this cafe was overshadowed by the conduct of a single staff member. In order to cultivate a truly exceptional dining experience, it is crucial to ensure that every member of the team exhibits professionalism, respect, and a commitment to customer satisfaction (and most importantly, manners). We sincerely hope that steps will be taken to address this issue, as it would be a shame for future patrons to endure similar treatment.",2023,consider effort busi owner manag put creat pleasant dine experi visit cafe mar behavior server encount jose assign waiter left desir term courtesi profession onset jose interrupt initi waitress attend tabl embark unsolicit lectur distinct tap water simpl request water unnecessari condescens left neg impress mother inquir type croissant jose respond curtli suggest approach bakeri stand question accommod respons involv acknowledg option chocol pistachio tradit advis verifi avail bakeri due high demand respons lack tact carri underton insol similar encount unfold father sought clarif rel strength latt compar cortado jose respond sarcast smile uncal rude gener atmospher made feel guilti vers coffe intricaci dishearten excel potenti cafe overshadow conduct singl staff member order cultiv except dine experi crucial ensur member team exhibit profession respect commit custom satisfact importantli manner sincer hope step address issu shame futur patron endur similar treatment,-1,0.8316

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,2,"What I thought of the most viral croissant on TikTok. They only serve it at 3 times 10am - 12pm - 4pm We waited more than 1 hour in line. Honestly, its not worth the price or the time to wait. The only thing that was worth it was the experience. They put on a lot of show for little, in Brazil Im sure well find much tastier and better quality croissants. We were the first in line, and the graduate that they say would leave at such a time is just a marketing strategy. Because the croissant we ate didnt come out at that time, it was cold and hard, it looked old, like it had been made the day before. I thought it was a lack of consideration for those who wait so long, they delivered that type of croissant. If I could turn back time, I wouldnt waste my precious time in New York, to eat him. Im not saying its bad, it was good. But nothing much. I wouldnt go back there, because I know I find things much more delicious than it. Nothing extraordinary.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,1,"First of all we went around 9 in the morning and there was the only thing that people visit this place for. Lousy production. Sitting down to have breakfast we are told that we cannot order anything from the bakery. Absurd. When they served us breakfast, the omelet with the potatoes arrived first and they forgot the coffee, I had to ask for it. When the coffee arrived, breakfast was already cold. I decided to order an orange juice since the coffee was very strong and I doubted whether they had made it decaffeinated as I requested, I wasnt going to risk it. They forgot about the juice and brought it back when we were done, so I refused to accept it. The waitress approached me very rudely to tell me that there was only one barista and the truth is that that is not my problem at all. When we decided to pay, they did not have a contactless payment machine (strange) and they told me that they were going to delay the collection of my order. Having paid, which I did with USD 100, they should have given me 23.78 in change and they only gave me 23. The situation was already bothering me quite a bit. When I left the waitress asked me if I was going to leave a tip and obviously I said no. My question is the following: With what face, after such excellent service, do you ask me for a tip? The truth is that it was an unpleasant experience, very bad treatment and the non-existence of their  star  product. Its a place I never plan to go to and if you ask me, I would never recommend it. And finally, I think it is very expensive for what they offer and the only nice thing about this experience is the place, which is beautiful.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,3,"I was super excited to visit this place for a very long time, but my experience was rather disappointing. I expected a higher level of service and better quality food especially given the price tag this place carries. We came for dinner and I must say I liked the vibe of the place very much - jazz music subtly playing, intimate French decor, dimmed lights, stunning bar - all on point! Plus the staff was very well dressed, something I enjoyed very much and wish to see more in a similar type of restaurant! However the rest of the evening, including the food, drinks and service was a let down. We ordered two French wines, but they were not good in taste - I understand that might be personal preference but all 6 of us agreed on that. Over the course of the night we had multiple waiters and they seemed out of sync - they kept forgetting to fill our wine glasses and it came to the point we had to proactively call one of them to refill the wine, they tried multiple times to take our plates away even though we were not finished. When it comes to food, the bread served with butter was good, but the crust of the bread was heavily burnt and tasted like charcoal. I only had a french onion soup which was not my favourite - very beefy with actual chunks of beef and very little onion.

While it was good, I was underwhelmed, especially seeing that the line for these croissants snakes around the corner on weekends. The croissant itself was not too sweet, which was a plus for me, but it was a bit on the dry side. The pistachio cream was delicious in the top half of the croissant and lacking on the bottom half. While I wouldnt necessarily go out of my way to wait in line for this croissant, I was glad to have been able to check it off my list. At the steep price of $9.50, this is probably a once and done treat.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,1,"I recently had the opportunity to dine at the Lafayette restaurant, and while the food was certainly enjoyable, I found myself thoroughly disappointed with the lack of service and care provided by the staff. The restaurant itself was packed to the brim, with a queue stretching out the door and around the corner, reminiscent of the crowds at Everest Basecamp. However, it seemed that the popularity of this spot was driven more by New Yorkers insatiable desire to be trendy and relevant rather than the quality of the dining experience. Unfortunately, this lack of service is becoming an all-too-common trend in New Yorks dining scene, with many popular spots neglecting the basics of hospitality. The tipping culture and lack of attention to detail are leading to the downfall of proper dining, which is a true shame for those who love the art of dining. Even though Lafayette offers a delectable croissant, it cannot excuse the lack of service provided. In fact, this cult following should be an embarrassment to the establishment itself. Its disappointing to see a restaurant prioritize its image over the satisfaction of its guests, as it ultimately leads to an unfulfilling experience. As someone who values a proper dining experience, I hope to see a shift in the New York dining scene towards an emphasis on service and hospitality. While good food is certainly important, it is the experience as a whole that truly sets a restaurant apart. If restaurants continue to neglect this aspect, they will inevitably lead to their own downfall.",2023,recent opportun dine lafayett restaur food enjoy found disappoint lack servic care provid staff restaur pack brim queue stretch door corner reminisc crowd everest basecamp popular spot driven yorker insati desir trendi relev qualiti dine experi lack servic common trend york dine scene popular spot neglect basic hospit tip cultur lack attent detail lead downfal proper dine true shame love art dine lafayett offer delect croissant excus lack servic provid fact cult embarrass establish disappoint restaur priorit imag satisfact guest ultim lead unfulfil experi valu proper dine experi hope shift york dine scene emphasi servic hospit good food import experi set restaur restaur continu neglect aspect inevit lead downfal,-1,0.2263

I think for the bakery area but in short, its better to book than never go wrong) Inside on the right there is the bakery with a delicious display case with sweets and sandwiches, and the rest of the place is set up as a restaurant area. We ate in the restaurant area, they put us in a nice position, in the morning the sun lights up the whole place and it is very pleasant.

Finally, we chose a cappuccino, pancakes and an egg sandwich which, given the price of the latter, arrived a little small for what we expected but very good. Excellent pancakes!

The rest of the restaurant is a nice french bistro. The bread in the bakery also looked amazing. We may come back for the bistro or other pastries but wont be for the spiral croissant.

I thought the food was excellent and was so happy that one did not have to go to Paris to eat exquisite quiche, omelette and  pastries etc. I immediately came back this Valentines weekend with the other two Hazelnuts and recruited 4 more friends to have brunch at Lafayette. We ordered the quiche, omelette, salmon benedict, croque madame, and the boulangerie basket. I also ordered extra pastries from the bakery to share at the table. Let me begin by saying the supreme croissant was very good. We were able to acquire 2, one which we ate immediately, the other we ate 4 hours later. It held up well. In fact, I thought it tasted better eaten later when the filling was not as oooey gooey. The frittes that came with the croque madame was also very good. The boulangerie basket was as good as I remembered, it was gone in an instant. My husband ordered the quiche which I had raved about all December long. It was just mehhh this time. We  ve had much better quiche at our local French Cafe in Venice, Florida ( Croissant and Co ). My son s omelette I could have recreated at home. So I guess consistency is not there. I was just let down because I brought my husband and son for this food trip and gathered our friends and raved about this place and it was just mehhh.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,2,"A few months ago, in Barcelona, everybody started talking about a local bakery that sells the new trending pastry in NYC: a round croissant filled with pistachio. I have never had the opportunity to try it out and, to be honest, that does not sound too appealing to me: in my opinion, a croissant must be shaped like a   and, most of all, it must be plain! (or it s a cornetto ) But again, when we arrived in NYC, we didnt know anything about the city anymore, so we checked on the Internet. I looked for salty food and my wife looked for sweets (well, I did look for ice creams and doughnuts myself, to be fair) and she found Lafayette, the original  inventor  of this round pastry (they call it Supreme, btw, but it s  a croissant). First, we had to queue (under the rain!) for about 20 minutes to get inside just to order to go... While we were queuing, we could see through the Windows all the content creators inside showing a camera how much they were enjoying their Supreme: sad. Once inside, I was amazed by... the darkness of the venue. I couldnt even see what I was ordering. Honestly, I knew what I was coming for, otherwise, I couldnt have known what to order... they dont want us to see what we eat? Thats a shame because, when I got used to the darkness, I could guess that the venue actually looked very nice. I sincerely dont know why they dont turn the light on. So the clerk at the counter told us about the 4 flavors available that day and we picked pistachio and the seasonal: Supreme de Noel. I must say that the pistachio Supreme was very good, at least the half where there was cream. The other half was just like a regular croissant, a good one but nothing from another world either. The Supreme de Noel was not that good, the cream was too thick, I guess to make it seem like an actual buche but that didnt fit the Supreme so much. Dont get me wrong, it was not bad, but for $10 a piece and a 20-minute rainy line, I expected way more. I would trade this for a good croissant or a pistachio cornetto anytime.

Both croissants were far too indulgent for us to finish.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,3,"Lafayette cafe & bakery is an excellent example of how visibly long lines do not necessarily equate to food that makes the wait worth it. I initially heard about Lafayette through various food blogs that were raving about their delicious take on French cuisine and baked pastries. Upon my arrival to Lafayette, I was stunned and a bit intimidated by the supremely long ling wrapping around the corner block to get into the restaurant and bakery. Once my party and I were seated at a snug booth table, we ordered their boulangerie basket of pastries, brunch brisket burger, lemon ricotta pancakes topped with berries, a croque madam, and a round of cold brew. Additionally, we lined up to get their highly rated pastries from the bakery (of which their signature pastry, The Supreme, a kouign aman-esque take on the famed French croissants) was not available for restaurant guests to feast on. For good reason, the resto-cafe had a long history of guests making reservations at the busy cafe, only to order The Supreme, and nothing else. Now, onto the food review, the cold brew was bland and frankly, quite bitter. The tray of assorted pastries were unremarkable and were not worth the $25 listed price. The brunch brisket beef burger was tender, juicy, and surprisingly well seasoned, the accompanying fries were fantastic. The croque madame was simply bland and its only redeeming quality was a generous serving of ham for its filling. The lemon ricotta pancakes were equally mediocre asides from the copious helping of assorted berries. Finally, with regards to the pastries from the bakery, myself and my party felt that many of the items were too doughy, overbaked, and simply not worth the wait. However, the service and staff was on-par with a restaurant of this quality, the waiters were attentive and helpful. Plus points for the beautiful decor and exceptional waitstaff team. If I were to sum up my experience at the Lafayette, I would simply say that it is overhyped standard French cuisine fare.

We ended up getting a raspberry danish, the maple bourbon spiral croissant and sat down for breakfast. The breakfast omelette was fairly average - nothing too exciting.  The bread that came with it was delicious and like a typical French breakfast, the bread was accompanied by yummy jam. The raspberry danish was very good, the danish was flaky and you could tell they used real butter and the flavor of the raspberry filling was just enough not to make it overwhelming. The spiral croissant honestly was a let down. The lamination was not that great, I am wondering if they used real butter for it, and the cream in my opinion was way too much and did not have the best of flavors.

On the first day they made us sit quietly on the mezzanine floor at a well-decorated table; the cappuccino was spectacular, creamy at the right point (even though it wasnt what was requested given that we had repeatedly said latte macchiato and then caffe latte); and the amaretto croissants took you straight to Paris so much so that they were good. Delicious peeling like few others and the amaretto not at all stomach-churning. Everything changed on the second day. For some strange reason, the rules of the place do not allow breakfast to be served if you do not strictly take what is written on the menu, so we were rudely kicked out from the mezzanine floor and had to re-order. We were drawn here by the photos of the different flavored cinnamon rolls, as they looked very intriguing, but that was the beginning of the end. The very good pastry was irremediably ruined by the various toppings: a mousse that didnt taste like chocolate, a pistachio cream that had nothing pistachio-like and finally a coconut cream that actually tasted like lemon. To crown this second terrible experience, a latte macchiato (finally understood as a term) which however only tasted burnt. We left with a chemical taste in our mouths and a stomach ache.

It did not seem very efficient and he was kind of slow especially given the dozens of people waiting in line outside. I would definitely not wait in the 1-2 hour line that Ive heard about.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,1,"What a joke. Here are the issues: 1. They dont let you order the croissants even if you have a reservation for brunch. 2. They only allow each customer to order maximum one croissant. Its obvious that they dont care how far the customers traveled here, how long the customers waited on the line outside, and how customers feel. 3. We waited outside for an hour, then we were told that the croissants were sold out when it was almost our turn. This is so unprofessional. 4. Their brunch tastes ok, but the portion is pretty small, plus its quite expensive. The service is ok. Overall, an overrated place. In my opinion: Whoever made the croissant rules needs to see a doctor. The establishment should allow leastly 2 croissants to be ordered for each customer, considering the long waiting time and the potential risk of a customer who has never tried their croissants and ordered a wrong one by mistake.

The breakfast was surprisingly good and the assortment of pastries brought to the table was superb. Everything was good including the environment.

After my breakfast, I was told that I had to wait an hour for the croissant in line in the hot sun. I was prepared for this and stayed in the long line. After about an hour I got the croissant but only one of them because there was a one limit per person. After getting the croissant it was not worth the hype.

Gary made this one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in the many years that I ve been frequenting New York and I cannot wait to see him again when I make the official move here next month.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,2,"This place has been hyped up for so long, so I got a reservation for two about a week ago in advance for brunch. When we got there and sat at our table, our waiter informed us that if we want one of their famous croissants we cannot order them from the restaurant, we have to wait in a line outside. So stupid! If were spending a hundred dollars at your restaurant, the least you can do is let us order a croissant for our dessert, not tell us to go wait in a queue outside after we eat! Fine, moving on. When we were sat, two tables next to us were sat after. One about 5 minutes, the other after 20. Both of these tables got their order before us. One even finished eating. We ordered an overpriced burger and croque madame! It took us a ridiculously long time to get our food. We didnt even complain, but it was bewildering. At this point, I was starving and just hoping the food would be good. But it wasnt. Worst croque madame I have ever had! Even the fries were extremely salty and I couldnt finish half of them. The only thing positive I can say is apparently the burger was good, but Im not the one who ordered it. Also, the restaurant itself is cozy and our waiter and the wait staff were nice as well, despite how long it took to receive our food. Funny enough, our waiter told us he wouldnt wait in the line around the block for one of their croissants, so that made me feel less bad about not getting one.

The cinna-cruffin was okay but I will not be buying any more. It s is essentially a croissant posing as a muffin. I must have missed the muffin part.

People come for the Supreme Croissant seen on IG ($9, limit 1 per person, put out 8am and 12pm daily), but its more marketing than taste. Looks beautiful, rotating flavors, thick filling, but cold and stiff. Crunchy and flaky if thats what you want. I prefer a croissant to be so buttery and warm and fresh that the flakes and pastry melt in your mouth. These are fun to try but not worth the wait or cost. The restaurant is also lackluster.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,1,"I have always loved this restaurant. I went years ago for my friends 30th birthday and have been several times since. The food has always been delicious. But, after my last time coming with a group for a prefix brunch I will never be coming back. This restaurant is rude and has a complete lack of communication and customer service. I reserved a table for 14 on their online booking app. 14 was the max I could get, however our party was for 15 so I requested 15 in the notes. But I never heard back confirming they could do 15. All communication from them said 14 so I assumed they couldn t do it and our group size changed accordingly. They even confirmed 14 via text the day before and I did as well when I confirmed our reservation. During the brunch the food took forever. One of the couples in our group had to leave after two hours to make a flight and the entrees hadn t even come yet. You d think for a family style prefix the food would come regularly. The coffees didn t come until halfway through the meal. Then the bill came and we had all been there so long we were rushed to leave and we just signed and left. After reviewing the check later, they had charged us for 15 people after all that. $75 pp and we had only 14. Since they don t have a phone # to actually speak with someone, I emailed and asked for a refund. After a week of going back and forth they finally refunded me the $75 but didn t refund me the tax and tip for the extra person. This is absurd. I shouldn t have to fight for a refund for an extra plate when we never had a group of 15. Any restaurant with good service would have called me to discuss this like I requested several times and they would have rectified the situation immediately. Lafayette never even apologized and blamed me for the whole thing saying  for the future, we require 24 hours notice for any changes in party size to Chefs Menu.  For the future, I won t be coming back and neither will my friends and family.",2023,love restaur year ago friend birthday time food delici time come group prefix brunch come back restaur rude complet lack commun custom servic reserv tabl onlin book app max parti request note heard back confirm commun assum couldn group size chang confirm text day confirm reserv brunch food forev coupl group leav hour make flight entre hadn famili style prefix food regularli coffe didn halfway meal bill long rush leav sign left review check charg peopl pp don phone speak email ask refund week back final refund didn refund tax tip extra person absurd shouldn fight refund extra plate group restaur good servic call discuss request time rectifi situat immedi lafayett apolog blame thing futur requir hour notic parti size chef menu futur won come back friend famili,-1,0.836

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,1,"This bakery has so much potential but we were disappointed. The croque monsieur was toasted on one side but not the other, whatever they used to heat it up caused it to become soggy. It didn t taste like it had been made with French jambon or high quality French cheese. The salmon spinach quiche was way too salty ( very little salmon, very soggy overcooked spinach inside) and the tart shell was under baked (the eggs were the perfect consistency of a delicate egg custard but the entire quiche was very soggy from the heating process. The vanilla flan had a nice custard texture but didn t have that eggy flavor that it should have nor did it taste like high quality organic heavy cream was used, the vanilla wasn t coming through either ( the crust was also under baked. For these 3 items and two coffees we paid $30 which I would have rather spent on a nice dinner somewhere else. The espresso here was very good however we were given full caf when we ordered decaf. The woman at the counter was very rude and unhelpful. Most customers seemed afraid of her and just silently waited until they could quickly get their order and leave. Would not come here again.

The balance between the mild acidity of the fruit and the softness of the cream   a perfect combination. I prefer it more than the chocolate one, that one made me sick a little.

Luckily Lafayette had a ton of open space and was able to seat us immediately. The ambiance is great. We loved the booth seating and the decor. The service was good but was a little lacking for such a fancy restaurant. We had to wait a very long time before receiving menus, and then before ordering, and then in between courses, though the staff was very kind when we did interact. We ordered the escargot, pasta with tuna, for dessert the Mille feuille, and each got a drink. Unfortunately the escargot and pasta were both too salty. The mille feuille was perfect- that was a 5 star dessert. And I ordered a margarita and asked for mezcal instead of tequila which they up-charged us for on the bill. Not something to detract stars for but something good to know. Overall we enjoyed the experience and loved the dessert, but the saltiness of the food and the cadence of the service detract a star.

Their avocado salad was like no other salad I ever tried. Wow! Their beet salad was delicious. I asked, and...They fry their french fries in separate oils from other non vegetarian foods. So I tried their French fries with ketchup. I dont normally eat french fries. So they may have tasted way, way, way better than I have had before. But it could be that it has been awhile since I have had French fries. So maybe they always taste great, which is why they may be such a popular item all over the U.S. Or maybe these were just so good that even though I was full, I had to have more. I normally dont do desserts. And I know people use excuses like its a holiday, so I will break my diet. But it was Christmas morning Brunch. So tried their cookies. Some may not have been cookies.

As far as my experience here, I d say the food was really good, and so was the ambiance. I would recommend the banana foster French toast; I ve never had anything like it. I could sit here and describe it to you, but I think the better idea would be for you to just go try it - seriously, it s that good. Despite my raving about the French toast, I actually chose the lemon pancakes for my meal. I for sure thought they were good, especially with the fresh berries, but I d have to say they went a little lighter with the lemon than I had hoped for. I must mention, if you do wind up coming here for brunch, you should definitely get a side of bacon because it, too, is really good. I thought the service here was pretty good, but nothing outstanding. Our server was friendly, but obviously busy with other tables. Another thing of positive note is that the restaurant is on the nicer side, but the prices were reasonable (~20 per item) which was pleasing.  I will definitely make this a go to place for brunch now!",2020,great place sunday brunch famili ve walk time ve want glad final experi food good ambianc recommend banana foster french toast ve sit describ idea good rave french toast chose lemon pancak meal thought good fresh berri lighter lemon hope mention wind come brunch side bacon good thought servic pretti good outstand server friendli busi tabl thing posit note restaur nicer side price reason item pleas make place brunch,1,0.9842

I had the call them 3 (!) times and they passed me from one person to the other (total 50 mins!!) and I had to repeat everything again and again to different people because  we are not sitting in the same building . Finally on the last call they told me they could not find my reservation or emails   and that they couldn t accommodate the group 70 mins prior to our original reservation!

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,4,"Went to Lafayette for an amazing dinner. The ambiance was loud yet refined. We were seated in the vestibule near the entrance, and whenever new guests arrived we were met with a chill. Tldr: get the dry aged duck if available Onto the food: Steak Tartare: was good, not memorable. And for the first time in our tartare experience, we were left with more bread than tartare. Risotto Basquaise: the first couple bites were delicious, but as we kept eating, it tasted more like a fancy pizza sauce with risotto and shrimp. The Serrano ham just tasted like crispy bacon. Would not order again. Black Macaroni: This was spectacular, we absolutely destroyed the dish. The macorni was on point, the lobster and cuttlefish were prefectly accented with crushed tomatoes and garlic sauce. At this point we were stuffed, but here come the entrees. Grilled local trout: The trout was cooked perfectly and accompanied by coco beans and sauce that was not memorable. Dry Aged Duck: THIS STOLE THE SHOW. We were absolutely stuffed, but one bite into the crispy skin and we couldnt stop. It was a perfectly cooked medium rare duck breast with a touch of melt-in-your-mouth duck fat....OMFG. It was accompanied by a delicious butternut squash puree and Foie Gra jus that took the dish to the next level - at this point we just ignored the trout and cleaned the plate.

I am happy to say that I had another opportunity to have dinner at Lafayette and it was a totally different experience. Since there were five of us at dinner, listing the 15 dishes we ordered would not be productive but I can say that each was perfectly prepared, presented and served.  Some highlights were the Frisee Salad, the Escargot, the Trout, the Oxtail Bourguignon  Ravioli,  the Aged Duck and an exquisite pear dessert. We were warmly greeted by Crandell and Tamika. Luis was a very attentive and professional server. Melissa served us dessert and was especially attentive to my grandson. I would  definitely recommend Lafayette for gracious and delicious dining!

We sat down and I ordered the Nicoise (without anchovies), and I have no idea why but it had the fishiest taste to it. I was with friends and didn t want to make a fuss and was just going to leave the tuna and eat everything else, but then I thought how stupid that was   to pay $30 for a green salad. When I tried to quietly explain that there was something up with the salad, I got a passive aggressive lecture from a waiter, in extremely docile calming tones, about how there was nothing wrong with the salad. He eventually took it away. Then the waitress who had been serving us came back with the salad, again telling me there was nothing wrong with it. In the end I had to say,  I don t want the salad! Take it away! I ended up ordering a burger which was OK.

When we arrived at the restaurant 4 people came in ahead of us without a reservation and asked for a booth to which they were taken. Although I had requested a booth in my reservation which we were on time for we were told that there were no booths available and that we would have to wait for them to clean one off. When we were finally seated we had a very nice booth by the window as I requested. We ordered our breakfast which included coffee. They brought our meals and that was the end of the staff. No one ever came back to our table to ask if everything was OK or if we needed anything. I had to flag down a busboy to get some butter and twice to refill my coffee. I also asked said busboy for more cream for the coffee but that never came . The prices were high but I dont mind paying more if the service is good. So if youre looking for overpriced food in a beautiful setting and terrible service this is the place for you!,2018,food atmospher wonder servic terribl made reserv ahead time request booth arriv restaur peopl ahead reserv ask booth request booth reserv time told booth wait clean final seat nice booth window request order breakfast includ coffe brought meal end staff back tabl need flag busboy butter refil coffe ask busboy cream coffe price high dont mind pay servic good your overpr food beauti set terribl servic place,-1,0.8269

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,2,"Came here with my wife for a afternoon lunch. Not too busy and getting seated was fast. However, it took us a while to get offered water, and about 20 minutes after that until we were even offered any other drinks. At this point we ordered a cheese platter, a sandwich, and a salad. After another 20 minutes, we finally received our cheese platter. It was very good cheeses, although nothing that you would be unable to get elsewhere. It has been another 15-20 minutes since we finished our cheese platter when the server asked if we had ordered food, which is a major oversight and very obnoxious since other tables have been served and cleared in the interim. Eventually, another server said he would check on our food, and nobody seemed to know what was taking so long. Our original waiter eventually told us he was waiting for us to finish the cheese, which is negligent at best (since we were done for a while) and a lie at worst. Regardless, our food came out hot and was very good, although maybe not the slightly higher prices. The atmosphere seemed nice, but we spent the whole lunch in the outdoor seating. Overall, I couldnt really recommend Lafayette. Our service was atrocious and confused, and the food is good but abnormally pricey. Its fine if you are in the area and want some French cuisine, but hopefully the service is better than ours.",2018,wife afternoon lunch busi seat fast offer water minut offer drink point order chees platter sandwich salad minut final receiv chees platter good chees unabl minut finish chees platter server ask order food major oversight obnoxi tabl serv clear interim eventu server check food take long origin waiter eventu told wait finish chees neglig lie worst food hot good slightli higher price atmospher nice spent lunch outdoor seat couldnt recommend lafayett servic atroci confus food good abnorm pricey fine area french cuisin servic,-1,0.8267

Lets say it was decent, its NYC, so I can expect it will be a little bit costy. alright, alright. And the bread they served us was really delicious. Then we had a ribeye steak for Entree (it was a huge Entree for 2, it was a a special of the day). It was a total failure... Half of the meat was cooked nicely but the other half was over cooked and all the meat was completely over salty... Even the puree (mash potatoes) done in a Robuchons style was a failure : again, over salty. The gravy, I already forget about it. And I am someone who his eating salty. What a shame for a restaurant.... Serving such an average food. I mentioned it to the server while we were half our way with the meat (yes we were starving !!) and he just said nothing and didnt offer us anything. He just vaguely apologized.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,5,"I have been wanting to go to Lafayette for some exquisite, upscale French-inspired desserts for a long time. We finally got to make our way over to this sweet heaven. The inside was nice and bright, thanks to the large window that goes all the way up to the ceiling on the wall facing the entrance. Lafayette is consist of bakery and Cafe, which is more like a restaurant. If you are taking some bread or dessert home instead of eating in, or if you just wanted some sweets and coffee, then you don t need to go into their Cafe. The front right section is the bakery, and the rest of the space is the Cafe. We were only there for the dessert, so we sat at the bakery section. The bakery was filled with all sorts of yummy delight and its smell. We were surrounded with the perfumes of sugar, flour, cream, and every fluffy sweet goodness.  We decided on few things to eat right there, and few other things to take home with. For eating in, we chose Petit Choux, Cascara Slice, and Cappuccino. We got the little shiny treats that looked like jewels. Little jewels that taste amazing.... Our Lafayette experience made us say we wish if we could go there every day.

With that said, I really enjoyed the dimsum from here...especially the spare ribs with the black bean sauce. Everything else tastes good, but the star player is definitely the spare ribs. The kicker? $2 per plate Monday-Saturday. Youll see a lot of old folks here on the weekends..and youre probably going to split a table..but for $2, its well worth it.

Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,4,"Reviewing as a dinner restaurant with a note to self to return for brunch. Lafayette gets five stars for the French country rustic decor and vibe it seemlessly executes.  Tile floors and backsplashes, wainscoting, and warm gold/ brown/ white tones soften the metal hardware of the light fixtures, rails and handles peppered throughout the space.  The outdoor seating is ample and spacious, though the interior was something we were pleased to experience. Drinks and food are both excellent in portion  (almost surprisingly so since its upscale French) and execution.  Cocktails run about $13-15, but quality spirits, a generous pour, and service with a single large cube made it seem fair.  I savored the Vermouth Amelie with a soft, mildly sweet taste of dark liquor and citrus.  The lamb tangine left me awestruck from service (presented in a covered Moroccan patterned dish) through each savory bite.  Pieces of lamb simmered slowly in eastern flavors with chunks of carrot and other veggies (seemed like a cousin of zucchini but I couldnt place it) left it soft as butter.  The couscous was flavorful, and  served with toasted, slivered almonds, and a midly salt and garlicked yogurt. My mom had the wood grilled trout.  While my dish was heartier and fit for a chilly day or to serve a hearty appetite, the trout was reminiscent of light Spring flavors.  It was the type of meal youd truly enjoy eating, but then feel good inside and out for good clean nourishment. Of course there was dessert to the tune of a salted caramel mille feiulle.  The pastry was impossibly thin and flaky, and the caramel was fantastically real - not some melted high fructose corn syrup junk melted just long enough to serve.  We shared it and loved every second of it.  The only culinary downside for the evening was the bitterness of the coffee. So much good but only 3 stars.  Service was obviously figuring out its operation while we were there.  Our first waiter dropped off menus, but was quite slow to return for drink or food orders.  We had to ask for bread once our meals were served (we had bread plates, so knew it existed), and also for our water glasses to be refilled.  Once they got the memo, they were more attentive.  Four different waiters helped at some point or other, but they didnt communicate with each other making us have to repeat requests for things a few times.  They were wonderfully friendly and patient, but at a restaurant of this caliber I expect service on point. Prices are around $15 for appetizers, $10 for sides, $22-25 for pastas $33-36 for meats & fish, and $15 for dessert.
