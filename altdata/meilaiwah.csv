Some customers appeared to be heading inside, leading me to assume that they were paying with cash. I approached the cashier and inquired if I needed to use a different line for cash payments, and he confirmed that I should stay there. I proceeded to order their famous Pineapple bun with pork and ice Hong Kong milk tea. However, he informed me that they didnt sell   iced  , I told him that on your menu have that option. He consulted his coworkers for clarification. The pineapple bun was quite delicious, and I would recommend trying it. I really enjoyed their bun when I returned three days later. This time, I was the fourth person in line to pay with cash. When it was finally my turn, the cashier seemed to ignore me and started packing buns. I understood that it was busy, but she suddenly turned to the person on the other side and took their order. She mentioned that the line started on the side, which was confusing because I had been waiting in line. I also wondered about the people who were ahead of me. She didn t mentioned to them. Nevertheless, I must mention that the line setup and service left much to be desired. The staff appeared rude, unenthusiastic, and disorganized.

Mei Lai Wah,5,"Hands down one of the best bakeries in Chinatown (even in NYC) to get baked roast pork buns or pineapple roast pork buns. Theyre always made fresh daily, soft bread with a nice chew, savory meat, with the right balance of fatty pieces and pork. Love the sweetness from the pineapple bread crust if you opt for that bun (yes, you should). Theyre affordable at ~$2 each and are so so satisfying every time we get them. Although the lines are long at certain times of the day, theyre so worth the wait - and service is fast for the buns anyway! Mei Lai Wah also serves great food (currently to-go), like steamed rice rolls, dim sum, congee, and rice/noodle dishes. I love their congee. They used to be cash only at the counter, but now theres a kiosk right out front where you can order all the foods using a credit card.

It was good, but the other two were way better. If youre yolo-ing around Chinatown, then get all 3! Baked roasted pork bun- the bun was good, but the meat:bun ratio was significantly lower compared to the other two. Also, the meat in this one is sweet and savory, and though its not bad by any means, its kinda the middle child who isnt particularly great at anything. Steamed roasted pork bun- trusty spongy bun with a hefty amount of meat filling. The meat in this one isnt sweet, but savory and it goes really well with the rather bland bun. The texture profile of the spongy, slightly chewy bun with the melt-in-your-gob pork belly is phenomenal! Pineapple pork bun- honestly a great follow up to the steamed bun. This is the only one that had a sort of a crunchy layer on the top of the bun (think chunky glaze) and the meat:bun ratio is good. The sweet pineapple bun pairs really well with the savory pork. The slight crunchy texture is met with a dash of sweetness on your pallate which is followed by a hint of the savory melty pork which feels like a nice island in an ocean of sweetness which is followed by more sweetness, leaving a decisively sweet after taste, unlike the confused baked pork bun.

There was not a single soul in this establishment other than myself and the staff, as I was opening my first bun up to eat this young rude boy says to me that I cannot sit there. I looked around the restaurant and said to him I dont see anyone sitting around would you mind if I just took a minute to eat up my pork buns and leave? He responds by saying if I sit there and eat he needs a tip. And also adds that he needs to earn a living too. I am all for tipping for good service but to expect a tip for grabbing two pork buns is a bit much. I ended up returning the buns and leaving the restaurant.

When we left a tip thats less than 16% because a) the service wasnt superb, b) food wasnt great, and c) they only accept cash and we didnt have enough on us. So we left about 13% and told the server. He insisted that we fork out the 16% (as shown on the small A4 paper posted on the wall close to the bathroom in the back). I told him that the last time i came in, it wasnt mandatory and there was no notice/sign. He said that they just updated their policy and had just put the sign up. Then i told him that tipping is not compulsory, let alone asking for a 16% tip, plus we dont have enough cash on us anyway. He pointed outside and said that one of us can go get cash and the rest of us stay back here to wait. I was getting really annoyed at his attitude because he could have said something like, for this time its ok, but please be aware that this is our new policy and we hope to see you again next time. Moreover, its not like we left him nothing! I just felt like that was GREED and he totally blew his service rating by asking us to stay back and wait as if we were going to run away. After argueing with us for a while (he even challenged us all the way out to the door), he finally said out loud - so all the customers could hear, if you dont want to pay the tips, next time just order take out then. At that point, i was fuming and replied, there wont be a next time as i definitely will not step foot inside this place again. He then stormed off. And we left. I asked my friend if he still wants to go to the ATM to get him the rest of the tips, and he said NO WAY. Thats it. Never returning. Leave 16% and you are bid goodbye with a smile and welcomed back, leave 13% and you get true colors - insulted and humiliated. They never want to see you again.

Mei Lai Wah,5,"How was the ordering experience? I went in to Mei Li Wah knowing exactly what I wanted to order. When they were out of the Pineapple bun, not only was I devastated, I had to switch my order, which caused MASSIVE confusion. I suppose it was partially my fault, but the language barrier is a little bit of an issue here. Their English is very good, but not perfect and I had to question why I had five buns instead of four when it was all said and done. How delicious was the food? Three out of the four buns were AMAZING. I had two steamed roast pork buns, a famous bun (the one that isn t steamed), and a  Big Bun . The Big Bun had a very strong flavor. Perhaps my tastebuds aren t as adventurous as I d like to think, but I really couldn t stomach the big bun. It was simply a taste I couldn t deal with. The other 3 were great, though and I am pretty confident that the pineapple bun WOULD have been my favorite if they hadn t run out of it. I love pineapple. Did it fill me up for $5 or less? Absolutely. I was full after just 2 buns. And each bun was $.80!!! You can get a filling lunch for $1.60 total! The Big Bun was $1.60. It wasn t that much bigger AND I wasn t a fan, so that was a bit of a waste, but overall and absolutely incredible value. My total, for a lunch that ended up feeding me for dinner as well? $3.48! (for the first time, a Cheap Eats restaurant charged me tax! But given the prices, it was still absolutely worth it). Conclusion: Mei Li Wah makes the cut for one of the CHEAPEST cheap eats so far. Their good buns are amazing and the prices allow you to experiment.

I instinctively put it in my bug out bag but I had 5 minutes to walk to my next destination so why not try these fresh pork buns on my way. They are smaller than the buns Im used to eating. The filling in the bun is heartier. And by hearty I mean fatty. There is at least 2 pieces of big chunk of fat in the filling.  I had to spit the fat in a not in so inconspicuous way. But, in Chinatown its rude to point but not to spit. But in almost every bite there was a crunch from the glaze of the bread. I also like that the filling is not laced with the red food coloring that is ubiquitous in all Chinese bbq pork. I do like this version of baked pork buns but they are small and I wish they offered more other type of bread. They serve food I will try next time.

If youre looking for table service, Mei Li Wah was recently renovated. There are no more cats roaming the premises. Its now safe to indulge in noodles and rice.",2013,mei li wah bakeri pork bun chinatown famou filipino worker joke theyv good sens humor mei li wah type pork bun offer bake steam bake golden brown sweet bread steam fluffi riceflour dough fill pork good dozen theyr cheap fill snack dollar piec mei li wah sell dim sum item make cocktail bun fill coconut your tabl servic mei li wah recent renov cat roam premis safe indulg noodl rice,1,0.9325

Mei Lai Wah,3,"The food is quite good, particularly the pork buns, for which they are famous. The service, however, leaves much to be desired. The grumpy attitude that the entire staff seems to be in sets the mood immediately. My waitress tone of voice when taking my order was rather condescending and rude. Everything I asked for was plopped down on the table without care, after which she promptly turned around and walked away. Im not usually so negative on bad service, but that just rubbed me the wrong way.",2012,food good pork bun famou servic leav desir grumpi attitud entir staff set mood immedi waitress tone voic take order condescend rude ask plop tabl care promptli turn walk im neg bad servic rub wrong,0,-0.5423

Mei Lai Wah,4,"Ive passed by this place all the time when I was younger, but never knew what I was missing out on until my friends introduced me to Mei Li Wahs roast pork buns. OMG they were delicious and now I find myself returning and dropping by that area just for roast port buns. Ive tried a few of the other items there, but my favorite is the baked roast pork bun over anything else on their menu. Each time I go, I normally get at least two and thats with self control, otherwise I might be buying a dozen and finishing it before I even get home. The buns are so popular and its made continuously throughout the day, so everything is fresh and delicious.  Im craving them now just writing...",2012,ive pass place time younger knew miss friend introduc mei li wah roast pork bun omg delici find return drop area roast port bun ive item favorit bake roast pork bun menu time control buy dozen finish home bun popular made continu day fresh delici im crave write,1,0.6808
Mei Lai Wah,5,"Originally known as Mei Lai Wah, is now Mei Li Wah. Rarely will you find any antique shops, or antique restaurants around Chinatown anymore, mainly because more hip and contemporary restaurants are taking over. However, there are only a few of these places that still exist, and Mei Li Wah being one of them. What was once an antique cafe, which still is, has gone under a  major facelift to blend with other surrounding restaurants. Despite the changes to a more modern look, this place remains to be the KING of all buns. Mei Li Wah makes some of the best roast pork buns there is. People buy dozens and dozens of their tasteful treats. Each golden-glazed bun is packed with flavors, but the star of it all, are the chopped-up roast porks infused with carmelized onions. Along side with roast pork buns, they also make stellar Don-shan, an egg-like dessert cookie kind of thing. All I can say is that everything they serve is finger-licking-good. They may have a new look to their cafe, but that is not going to stop old-timers from coming back for more of their roast pork buns. Young and old alike, they come here for a chance to experience Mei Li Wahs signature buns. They have remained loyal to people of Chinatown since they have not changed their recipe at all. Lets hope they keep it that way! We need cafes like Mei Li Wah to keep Chinatowns tradition alive. Long live Mei Li Wah and their roast pork buns!",2012,origin mei lai wah mei li wah rare find antiqu shop antiqu restaur chinatown anymor hip contemporari restaur take place exist mei li wah antiqu cafe major facelift blend surround restaur modern place remain king bun mei li wah make roast pork bun peopl buy dozen dozen tast treat golden glaze bun pack flavor star chop roast pork infus carmel onion side roast pork bun make stellar don shan egg dessert cooki kind thing serv finger lick good cafe stop timer come back roast pork bun young alik chanc experi mei li wah signatur bun remain loyal peopl chinatown chang recip let hope cafe mei li wah chinatown tradit aliv long live mei li wah roast pork bun,1,0.9153
