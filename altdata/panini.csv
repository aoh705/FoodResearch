Anthony & Son Panini Shoppe,5,"Not many words are needed to describe this activity. Antonio, the owner (Italian but resident in Brooklyn for 30 years) is very nice and helpful. Its staff is kind, thoughtful and very polite. The quality is excellent. Both sandwiches (probably the highlight) and other products. The mozzarella (which I leave in the photo) is produced by them and they dont regret the one made in Italy. Worth visiting and enjoying the location because it is very friendly. In addition to the fact that on a normal day, you can meet some famous actor or singer, enjoy a sandwich with complete peace of mind.

Anthony & Son Panini Shoppe,4,"A restaurant? Not quite. A deli? Close. Came to the area because my friend was craving a chicken parm sandwich and this place had good reviews for Yelp. I expected to see a little shop with seating and tables, but this place looked as casual as can be. Due to the pandemic, the only way to order is via window where the cashier opens and closes to take your order. They do have options to order online via the food delivery services (Seamless/GrubHub) and also in person ordering (which they give you a number written on a post it). They accept both card and cash. Luckily they do have a bench around the corner of their shop which is where my friend me I enjoyed our sandwiches and appetizers. I ordered the  Off the Boat  panini (prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, arugula, and sun dried tomatoes) with a side of mozzarella sticks. My friend ordered the FDNY hero (chicken cutlet, vodka sauce, fresh mozzarella on garlic bread) with a side of sweet potato fries. We did the switcheroo with half our sandwiches just to get the balance. I loved my panini sandwich, eating it without feeling guilty, and with the filling to bread ratio just to my liking (I am normally not a bread person). The saltiness of the prosciutto was balanced nicely with the sweetness of the sun dried tomatoes, and the crunch of the arugula and bread, with the softness of the cheese provided a perfect envelope of flavors into each bite. Normally I am not a crazy arugula fan due to its slight bitterness in nature, but because of the cheese and the other ingredients, you can hardly taste the bitterness. The mozzarella sticks were huge, and fresh, with each bite having the stretch that I loved playing with. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the marinara sauce because it was too thin and watery. I have always preferred my sauce with little more substance and thickness. The FDNY sandwich for me was a little dry for me, as there was not much sauce in the sandwich. Also, there was a little too much bread for me. The sweet potato fries were good, and I did not expect anything less. In the Brooklyn area, towards Williamsburg? Craving a sandwich worth your money? Definitely check out this shop.",2021,restaur deli close area friend crave chicken parm sandwich place good review yelp expect shop seat tabl place look casual due pandem order window cashier open close order option order onlin food deliveri servic seamless grubhub person order give number written post accept card cash luckili bench corner shop friend enjoy sandwich appet order boat panini prosciutto fresh mozzarella arugula sun dri tomato side mozzarella stick friend order fdni hero chicken cutlet vodka sauc fresh mozzarella garlic bread side sweet potato fri switcheroo half sandwich balanc love panini sandwich eat feel guilti fill bread ratio like bread person salti prosciutto balanc nice sweet sun dri tomato crunch arugula bread soft chees provid perfect envelop flavor bite crazi arugula fan due slight bitter natur chees ingredi tast bitter mozzarella stick huge fresh bite stretch love play fan marinara sauc thin wateri prefer sauc substanc thick fdni sandwich dri sauc sandwich bread sweet potato fri good expect brooklyn area williamsburg crave sandwich worth money check shop,1,1

But situate them in a trendy neighborhood, stock the shelves with upscale snacks and a menu of inventive sandwiches that would make your head spin, and you can begin to understand why they call themselves a paninni store. Faced with too many options, I tend to freeze up and have trouble making a choice. Thankfully everyone I had seen was raving about the El Presidente Panini - deep fried chicken cutlets, salty bacon and a sweet topper of BBQ sauce, delicious!

There were so many different Paninis and Heros sandwiches to choose from! It seemed like the list of different combinations just went on and on! I had myself the FDNY hero sandwich because it was referred to by one of the kind employees that worked there. It consists of chicken cutlet, melted fresh mozzarela (which they made in the store, too!), home made vodka sauce, and all of that was served on fresh garlic bread. That had to be one of the best sandwiches Ive had in a long time, and I look forward to my next experience! Thinking about it now, one of the counter girls did mention that they had the vodka sauce for sale.
