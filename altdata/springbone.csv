Springbone Kitchen,1,"Is this place for real? I just spent $20 on a lamb meatball + rice bowl. First, I was surprised that the order took about 30 minutes to make after ordering at the register. Waiting, waiting and then more waiting in a restaurant where I was the only person standing inside. Second, I was even more surprised to find 3 marble-sized meatballs inside the bowl. I would be remiss not to mention the tasteless medley of vegetables and  bone broth rice  (whatever gimmick that is) comprising the remainder of this overpriced bowl of mush. Overall  what? Not only was this a huge waste of my time, but $20 for this? A meal for ants? Springbone is a short-term restaurant concept, designed to capitalize on the social media popularity of bone broth. At this price point and quality, this isn t a sustainable restaurant in any way. The Springbone concept will be gone soon (another year or two?) and I will cheer for its demise in the meantime.

Great quality, transparency and taste  BUT now the portions are getting smaller, especially the meat (i think i got a tablespoon worth of barbacoa) and it s $20 for a barbacoa bowl with mostly rice and beans which is not worth it. They also took away the Barbacoa Sandwich, which was the best item on the menu with gluten free bun, a big hunk of barbacoa, guac, and kimchi  healthy and delicious. Guessing because of margins.

They also offered to combine several flavors, etc. and were very interactive/ helpful. I ended up with the liquid gold beef bone broth and was very satisfied with the choice.

Springbone Kitchen,4,"My experience and knowledge of soups is embarrassingly limited and up until adulthood was completely dominated by Campbells Chicken Noodle Soup. I know. We all have our crosses to bear. Since I wasnt too hungry, this seemed like an ideal stop for a light Friday lunch yesterday. Ive noticed customers outside utilizing the to-go window before, so it wasnt surprising to me upon entering that this is pretty much exclusively a to-go crowd. Let me start with the overwhelming positive here - the bone broth was sensational. The bar wasnt too high for me (see prior paragraph), but I was blown away by the Liquid Gold bone broth. Perfect name. Just delicious and ideal for an overcast, slightly nippy fall day. If I were sick, Id probably do nothing but drink this. It was like a life-affirming elixir that tasted like Thanksgiving.  The herbs and vegetables they use to season the broth are flavorful, and thankfully theres nothing actually IN the broth - I have a texture-based palate for the most part, so Im super leery of having to chew and/or eat my soup. I dont know how they figured out that including coconut milk was a good idea, but I tip my cap to them. It adds a smoothness to the broth that, again, sets it apart from mainstream, regular soups. I wasnt expecting this somehow, but its packaged basically in a to-go coffee cup, so you can easily sip it in the street if you want. I noticed quite a few reviews mentioned that this place was overpriced, but I thought $6 or $7 for what I had was fine. Thats, what, 3 times more than a can of soup in the supermarket? And probably 3 times better, so Im not sure theres much of an argument to be made there. I also ordered avocado toast, which was about $8 or $9. This isnt specific to Springbone, but I think Im now officially done ordering avocado toast from pretty much anywhere. Its easy to make at home for a literal fraction of the cost, and its starting to bother me that most avocado toast now only come with one piece of bread. Im positive that it was the norm to get two pieces as recently as two or three years ago. This toast was fine - it had kind of a Middle Eastern/ethnic flavoring to it, but the selling point here by a considerable margin is the broth. The customer service left a bad taste in my mouth, but your mileage may vary. When I stepped up to the register, the woman at the counter didnt seem to be in a great mood; she never smiled and just wasnt particularly pleasant. It happens - it could have just been timing, it could have had something to do with the fact that the world has been an absolute dumpster fire for several years, etc., but it didnt feel friendly in there at all. That sentiment was reaffirmed a few minutes later. The broth came out almost immediately, which makes sense given the minimal prep time required. While I was waiting for the toast, I sat down at the little countertop that they have right next to the window looking out over the plaza toward Stone Street, which had two chairs and enough space to eat if needed. When the woman came over to give me the avocado toast, she told me I couldnt remain sitting there to eat because part of my body was blocking key sections of the menu on the wall. Thats a new one on me. Why on earth would you have a small, formal seating area with a tabletop if you cant eat there? And if the reason I was given was completely accurate, why would you put said formal seating area right next to and/or in front of the wall menu? Id also point out that the menu has separately been placed on the doors coming in and is readily accessible online. That dampened my enthusiasm for this place, which is a shame because up until then this was close to a perfect experience. The bone broth is amazing. This was probably the best time of year to discover it, and Im glad I did. Ill be coming back, but youd better believe Im going to remain standing while Im in there waiting for my Liquid Gold.",2023,experi knowledg soup embarrassingli limit adulthood complet domin campbel chicken noodl soup cross bear wasnt hungri ideal stop light friday lunch yesterday ive notic custom util window wasnt surpris enter pretti exclus crowd start overwhelm posit bone broth sensat bar wasnt high prior paragraph blown liquid gold bone broth perfect delici ideal overcast slightli nippi fall day sick id drink life affirm elixir tast thanksgiv herb veget season broth flavor thank broth textur base palat part im super leeri chew eat soup dont figur includ coconut milk good idea tip cap add smooth broth set mainstream regular soup wasnt expect packag basic coffe cup easili sip street notic review mention place overpr thought fine time soup supermarket time im argument made order avocado toast isnt specif springbon im offici order avocado toast pretti easi make home liter fraction cost start bother avocado toast piec bread im posit norm piec recent year ago toast fine kind middl eastern ethnic flavor sell point consider margin broth custom servic left bad tast mouth mileag vari step regist woman counter didnt great mood smile wasnt pleasant time fact world absolut dumpster fire year didnt feel friendli sentiment reaffirm minut broth immedi make sens minim prep time requir wait toast sat countertop window plaza stone street chair space eat need woman give avocado toast told couldnt remain sit eat part bodi block key section menu wall earth small formal seat area tabletop eat reason complet accur put formal seat area front wall menu id point menu separ door come readili access onlin dampen enthusiasm place shame close perfect experi bone broth amaz time year discov im glad ill come back youd im remain stand im wait liquid gold,1,-0.7484

Springbone Kitchen,2,"Highly recommended by my NYC coworkers, I had to try Springbone before leaving NYC. Unfortunately, when I arrived at this location, I could see three workers back in the kitchen, but rather than acknowledging me and letting me know they would be with me in a moment, they completely ignored me until several minutes later after they had finished whatever they were working on. While examining the menu, I discovered that the entire menu is gluten free (I feel this is pretty understated as their website only mentions it in small print), which was a really pleasant surprise. I had a hard time understanding what was dairy free, though, as it is not marked on the menu. I ordered the Grandma s Rice & Chicken bowl after verifying that it was both gluten free and dairy free. Once I received my bowl, I went upstairs to eat and discovered that the water was completely empty. The location was not busy at all when I was there, so not sure what was going on. The dish itself was not my favorite  The lid on the container came away with about half of the sauce and the chicken was really dry. What I could taste of the sauces was pretty delicious, but there could have been more. If ever back in NYC, I probably wouldn t revisit this location, but I would give a different Springbone another try as it is a reasonably priced, convenient, 100% gluten free location.
