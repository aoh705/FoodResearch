Especially alarming seeing how many people are in the store and throwing out containers straight into the landfills can (yes they are using black plastic bag). If your whole business model is based on selling things in containers and did well, I m certain that you re profitable enough to at least take some accountability for the environment.

Woorijip,5,"A great spot for casual Korean food with plenty of food options. There are also alcohol/non-alcoholic drinks to go along with your meal. Price range for small appetizers: $4-7, lunch/dinner combo: $6-$12. There are at least 20-30 varieties daily with some seasonal menu items. I was delighted to find the Stir fried octopus with kimchee fried rice. True enough it tasted even better than it look. The octopus was so tender and flavorful. I also bought the spicy pork. It was very tasty but a bit too salty for me. The garlic fried chicken was good but I wish it was less oily. During my visit I noticed the staff regularly sanitize dining tables and seats for the diners. Kudos to the management for ensuring a safe and hygienic environment for everyone visiting! Its an eye opener seeing prepared food constantly strolled on a cart every few minutes from the kitchens doorway to the display rack. The kitchen staff here definitely can cook up a storm of Korean food. My family and I have been coming here for more than a decade.

If you ever need to get something to eat but dont want to sit down and be served, this is the perfect place for you! The Food does change everyday, and by the hour due to temperature danger zones. So expect something different from morning to night. Woorijip is a cafeteria type of establishment; you pick a tray and load it up with all the goodies your soul and wallet desire. Once done, you could either dine in after paying and heat up the food in their microwave or take out and enjoy it on your couch! If you pay cash, they do currently offer a discount, so I highly suggest doing so! If I lived in Manhattan, I would go here everyday lol. But I do come here at least once a month now!

He came back more aggressive, ready to assault us, took off his mask, as though ready to threaten us with his potential virus: Buy my food or Ill give you covid: and started singing the National Anthem. One could see him performing for money, but obviously it was: I will annoy and bother you until you give me money, in fact, and I will make you sick if I have to. I signaled the staff: Get this guy out of here. They ignored me. I told him off, he told me CAN I HELP YOU? No, Im not going to fight you with my 5 and 6 year old nephews here, go away. We cant help you, idiot. He went back to talking to the owners, who seemingly were in the know, and had told him to come get money from us.

Woorijip,5,"lately, i have been in the vicinity of Ktown and have been at Woorijip bc it is convenient and the prepared foods there are consistently good. the layout of things is pretty simple: seating in the front, registers toward the front, stacks of shelved boxed food neatly organized, refrigerated units of drinks and cold eats further back and further seating in the back. this place is super clean, always brightly lit, and has a simple welcoming vibe to hungry masses on west 32nd st. you can dine in here if you got the  jab  as they have a couple of tiny microwaves to warm up your food OR you can simply takeout. it s basically cafeteria style eating in a neat organized tasty way. this is also a great way to intro noobs to Korean food: 1) bc there s a good amount of variety of foods and sizes and 2) bc the quality is good and consistent. sometimes, i just come here to pick up a side of kimchi as i am kinda an addict to this pickled eat as a side when i make dinner. other times, when i am too lazy to cook the boxed varieties of Korean foods and other Asian eats hit the spot. recently, i had the clean rice noodles with bulgogi & spinach. the flavors are just what i wanted: savory, a little sweet, a little spicy, and full of comfort. the bulgogi is obviously shaved in no big pieces, but it works bc this is a simple dish. while the packaging makes it seem small this is an ample serving when it comes down to it. trust. boxed meals range from $5-$12 the rice noodles with bulgogi was $7 + tax. there are also a variety of smaller dishes like soups and sides in the $2-$7 range. choose your own adventure! the staff are pretty nice and have been hospitable even when the lines are long and it is super busy. and trust me, it s always busy in Ktown, just try waking through any time of day or night.",2022,vicin ktown woorijip bc conveni prepar food consist good layout thing pretti simpl seat front regist front stack shelv box food neatli organ refriger unit drink cold eat back seat back place super clean brightli lit simpl welcom vibe hungri mass west st dine jab coupl tini microwav warm food simpli takeout basic cafeteria style eat neat organ tasti great intro noob korean food bc good amount varieti food size bc qualiti good consist pick side kimchi kinda addict pickl eat side make dinner time lazi cook box varieti korean food asian eat hit spot recent clean rice noodl bulgogi spinach flavor want savori sweet spici full comfort bulgogi shave big piec work bc simpl dish packag make small ampl serv trust box meal rang rice noodl bulgogi tax varieti smaller dish soup side rang choos adventur staff pretti nice hospit line long super busi trust busi ktown wake time day night,1,0.9922
