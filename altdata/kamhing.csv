Kam Hing Coffee Shop,5,"It looks plain, but tastes great! The store is about a 3-minute walk from Canal Street, and there is also an Eaton space inside the store. Most of the customers are Asian (probably Chinese). This time, I purchased plain flavor, black sesame flavor, and red bean flavor. The price is $1 for plain and $1.25 for others. All three types were delicious. Its fluffy like a chiffon cake, not too sweet but still sweet, and soft yet chewy. Its not a gorgeous dessert, but its an unforgettable dessert.

I desperately needed to go to the bathroom and expected that I would need to buy something in order to use the restroom. To my surprise, the very kind cashier allowed me to use the restroom without having to spend any money. I felt very bad so I whipped out my credit card to buy a small coffee and didnt even realize that there was a minimum of $5 or $10. He still said it was okay regardless and this blew me away. In addition, they gave me a free spongecake to try and it was AMAZING.

It is always good to visit popular spot on a bad weather day. We got original, mint chocolate chip, and green tea sponge cake. They were really fluffy and airy, just as it was described by many of their fans. It was egg-y, sweet but not much, really light. As light as clouds. It is a simple sponge cake, but has that comfort flavor that reminds me of home-cooked or -baked feel to it. I see why their sponge cakes are popular.
