The flavors were rich and savory, with a depth that can only come from slow-cooking but the beef patty is the heart of what holds this beautiful concoction together. The curry goat MORE equally impressive( Called the Drake) The meat was incredibly tender, and the curry sauce had just the right amount of heat and spice was so savory ( best I will get the dish with rice and peas) !!!The flavors were well-balanced, also combined with Max & Cheese and sauce that had a perfect blend of aromatic spices that created a joy for my mouth!

It was definitely lacking seasoning & sauce. There were several other options on the menu, but we only tried the Datmacpatty & the fish. The fish could ve been better. Definitely needed more seasoning & was probably cooked too long because the inside wasn t fluffy. Very dry in my opinion. However, The owners/staff were friendly. Great experience. Would I recommend?

I thought the Jerk Chicken would be shredded not a thin piece of cutlet but that was whatever my main problem was that I found about three hairs in the food. It threw me off completely. I genuinely wanted to like this place because I ve heard so much about it but after finding the hair in my food and the Jerk chicken being very underwhelming I wouldn t recommend it.

Additionally, the Drake DatMacPatty, featuring goat curry and baked mac and cheese encased in a Caribbean-styled beef patty, was a taste sensation like no other. The choice of warm cocoa bread elevated the experience, making it a must-try for anyone seeking a unique and delicious dining adventure.

Theres a wait time due to the fame of this menu and I can attest that the food is very favorable! Due to how busy this place is the food is also extremely fresh & doesnt last long.

Datz Deli,3,"Thank you for the food. If possible, it would be more enjoyable if the worker at the cash register provided clear information as to where to form a line outside and got to the point when making speeches outside. She vented a lot about her long day and the heat, though we already knew about the long day and the heat, because we were standing outside for an hour  After going off topic about the weather, she was asked about when we would be able to order, she replied sarcastically that she was about to get to that and does this all day and to give her a second Long lines and waiting outside are expected for a small space. Relating to customers and speaking to them while considering the long line and relaying relevant information are all soft skills. We got there at 5pm and waited outside until 6pm to be allowed back inside to order. She came outside twice to talk about her long day and the weather along with minor updates about how she still is waiting on oxtail.  Even though not everyone in line actually wanted to order oxtail, we all had to wait together. No one complained, everyone just waited patiently. Maybe next time, all of those who are waiting to order oxtail can wait outside and those who are ordering what is in full stock can stay due to lack of space, and we can provide an update in about 15 minutes? Something like that is very helpful for happy customers who just wanted to patronize a local business and enjoy time with their loved ones along the way.

There s too much promotion and hype around this restaurant. The restaurant cannot support  due to its small confinements and lack of additional ovens. I waited on the line for over two hours outside , then it started pouring so they decided to let everybody inside. The hostess or staff that was given time estimates was giving in correct time estimates and we ended up waiting more time because the patties were sold out by the time we got to the door. While inside the store and placing our orders, we still had to wait due to only one person making patties for the entire restaurant. That was very inefficient And made the process even longer than it had to be. Also, the person making patties was not changing gloves and was cross contaminating chicken, shrimp, beef, etc. luckily I am a person that is not allergic to anything so I didn t mind personally, but anybody else was a vegetarian, would have been annoyed if they saw that, I blame TikTok and Instagram for the over hype of this restaurant and I hope the restaurant gets it together as far as meeting the demand of the people who are willing to wait over two hours for some patties.

Datz Deli,4,Honest Review. The hype for the Dat Mac Patty is a bit overhyped. I tried it for the first time and have to say with cocoa bread is good but without cocoa bread was a lot better. Wish they had given me extra gravy for the one with cocoa bread because that was kinda dry and second there wasn t enough oxtail meat. I actually thought they forgot to give me oxtail but when i fully opened it there was some in the back. I was expecting way more for $12 per patty. Other than that i like that everything is made from scratch. Fresh handmade patties. Mac was good. Oxtail had good flavor and spices. The only other con was the wait time. I expected maybe a 30min wait but even after getting in the door and ordering it took another 20-30mins. Is it worth the wait  i leave it up to everyone to experience it on their own.,2023,honest review hype dat mac patti bit overhyp time cocoa bread good cocoa bread lot extra gravi cocoa bread kinda dri wasn oxtail meat thought forgot give oxtail fulli open back expect patti made scratch fresh handmad patti mac good oxtail good flavor spice con wait time expect min wait door order min worth wait leav experi,1,0.9349

Best beef patty is the best  I ever had. The oxtail wasn t ready but on my list on my next visit. The service is excellent and the people are so nice and humble.

Datz Deli,5,"I heard all the hype surrounding Datz Delis MacPattys, and had to give them a shot when I heard they opened up a sister location in Manhattan. While, I wouldnt say its THE BEST sandwich in NYC, i would say its definately in my top 5. I had their signature oxtail macpatty, and it was delicious! The oxtail was tender, juicy, flavorful, and generous with the portions. You need a fork to eat the sandwich! The mac and cheese was savory and cooked to perfection, The cocoa bun was soft and flaky, soaking up every last bit of that oxtail gravy. I also partnered my sandwich with some one of a kind chips and drink, that i have not seen anywhere else.  The Biggie Smallz chips were meh, but the Jamaican root beer was excellent.

Datz Deli,5,"So shoutout to the world of social media because I discovered this place on TikTok and got recommended by my peeps to check out this place for their amazing Oxtail Patties. Nobody will ever understand just how amazing their food is, how the technique, the ingredients and the presentation just comes together and I ve been there 3 times now and the quality is always consistent. Super worth the commute from Brooklyn and I am just looking forward to the day where Datz Deli expands to more areas. If you got the time to go either location, plz do so because the vibe is always great and it s just an amazing experience to watch how they make the Patties.

Datz Deli,2,"After watching their documentary on YouTube and seeing people wait in lines for the Mac Patty is ridiculous. I got the oxtail Mac patty. Honestly I was hoping for excitement in flavor and to have a Caribbean feeling and taste and to be honest there was no flavor and I believe they are a little gasp up. The food is overhype and I would prefer a regular beef patty with coco bread and cheese at a regular Caribbean spot. I didn t enjoy it and I was sadly disappointed. I was hoping due to their following on social medias and their videos on people waiting in line and how they make it, it s really not that good at all. If you prefer taste, I don t recommend this place at all. If you want to try it out you can try it out some people might like that but it s overhyped. And for 12 dollars it s not worth it either. The workers were there were nice but I believe this gotta be a NY thing. If you do go there, good luck trying it!",2023,watch documentari youtub peopl wait line mac patti ridicul oxtail mac patti honestli hope excit flavor caribbean feel tast honest flavor gasp food overhyp prefer regular beef patti coco bread chees regular caribbean spot didn enjoy sadli disappoint hope due social media video peopl wait line make good prefer tast don recommend place peopl overhyp dollar worth worker nice gotta ny thing good luck,-1,0.9738
