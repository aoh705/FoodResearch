The bartender was very friendly and gave us good recommendations! We noticed that the boss was very present, which may have been because we were sitting at the bar. The food was great!!!

Skirt Steak,4,"Last night, my daughter and I ventured off to NYC and had dinner at Skirt Steak in the Flat Iron district. My daughter has been wanting to go here for some time after seeing it on TikTok. She s a steak lover and I love French fries so this place combined the best of both worlds. Skirt Steak had gone viral for its prix fixe menu where you order your 6oz skirt steak to your liking; well, medium well, medium or rare. This is accompanied by a salad with a little olive based dressing, and unlimited fries for $45. Other than fries, they do offer other sides which are limited: Scalloped potatoes with cheese & bacon and broccoli. Their sides are $12 additional and are ever changing, so expect something different if you go. They also offer an assortment of desserts for $12 as well. The beverage menu was a little limited that started at about $6. Overall the ambiance of the restaurant was quaint and intimate. If you go, expect a line at the door and the waiting time may average about 15 to 20 minutes depending on the size of your party. I was satisfied and I enjoyed my experience. My daughter and I order our skirt steaks medium which was served with a bearnaise sauce. In addition to the salad and unlimited French fries we order the potatoes smothered with cheese & bacon. I ordered a regular margarita which was pretty strong and my daughter ordered a Diet Coke. We also ordered dessert. I ordered a chocolate cake with icing and my daughter ordered the bloody orange tart. My chocolate cake was underwhelming but my daughter s dessert tasted like fruit loops  I really liked the tart. I didn t know what to expect since my daughter picked it but we both enjoyed our dinner experience at Skirt Steak. This is the place for you if you love red meat  there are NO other protein options. It s a pretty straightforward and to the point menu without the frills. I highly recommend getting your steak prepared medium as it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely return.

The steak comes at 3 temperatures; rare, medium, or well. I went with the rare. The steak was cooked perfectly to rare and had wonderful taste. The bearnaise sauce was the beat Ive had in a long time. Rich and smooth, on the thinner side as it should be. The fries were a perfect thin and crunchy shoe string style. The fries are unlimited, and I was asked if I wanted a refill, which I appreciated. Honestly, youre not going to beat the value. For what youre paying vs. the quality of food.

We were immediately brought a drink and a nice plate of salad while the host showed us the restaurants fixed dish, and yes! Because the local formula is: 1. A plate of salad served immediately 2. A cut of beef cooked to your needs. 3. All you can it chips. The meat was very soft, the salad non-trivial and the chips crunchy (but I add a little too salty). Optimal.

Note they will only cook steaks to rare, medium, or well--no half-donenesses. I picked medium (I would usually order medium-rare) and it was perfectly medium with a great char. My friend, who also usually orders medium-rare, went for rare, and she was absolutely delighted, but I wouldve found it too rare for me. The mustardy sauce that comes with the steak is utterly delicious on the steak as well as the fries (they charge you if you want extra of that, though!). Fries were great, and two helpings was certainly more than enough.",2023,arriv wednesday night seat insid spars popul left pm line door wait note cook steak rare medium half done pick medium order medium rare perfectli medium great char friend order medium rare rare absolut delight wouldv found rare mustardi sauc steak utterli delici steak fri charg extra fri great help,1,0.9584

They try to give a giant load on your plate right away as can be seen and also if you ask for more you may have to be on it for just a small scoop more so if you did again want more they will be tastier.

Skirt Steak,3,"My sibling and I arrived earlier than our family for a party of 6. We were celebrating my Aunties birthday and my mom really wanted to her go here. The host kindly let us sit down at a table to wait for our family (as the bar was not   accessible to her) We sat down and the first waiter asked what type of water we wanted. The other waiter arrived with the bottle of San Pellegrino and I was on the video chat with my family trying to find out if they were they were. The waiter then slammed the bottle down in the middle of the table and I m not sure why, but it upset me. The other waiter was rushing us to order even though my family had not arrived yet. So I ordered a glass of wine. Our server Sarah made up for the awkward  moments before. Sarah was kind and direct. Our order did get messed up (medium vs rare) honestly it s not that big of a deal to me. I enjoyed the simplicity of the entrees, very clean and tasty. Wasn t in love with the fries and they were pushing those fries. The interiors design is calm and sharp Scandinavian with an intelligent layout. I think the only thing that turned me off was this pretentious vibes going on for just  a down to earth salad, steak and fries. I don t know if the pompous attitude is suppose to makes the food taste better  or it s their secret sauce. But that was my experience and I had to work the rest of the evening to adjust my attitude.

Sauce, green salad and fries were super good! Ive rarely eaten such good fries, these are available with any second helping... The dessert, a strawberry cake, however, was expensive and had no flavor whatsoever. Side dish spinach (extra $12) very salty.

Skirt Steak,3,"Summary: good concept almost carbon-copied from French restaurant chain Relais de LEntrecote- and notably misses the mark on key elements. The Good: Overall, the restaurant decor, service, and food were top tier. Our server was Larissa, and we felt very much that we were well waited on throughout the night! For a Thursday night, we waited ~20 minutes, which I thought was perfect for a bustling restaurant. The ambience felt very warm and welcoming, and I loved the wooden columns and decor. The dessert selection was also excellent and very much on par with other NYC restaurants. The Not Good: Frankly, Im only giving this restaurant 3 stars because, as a concept, Relais de LEntrecote does it better. Charging $2 for extra Bearnaise felt very slimy, and felt like the restaurant was being stingy rather than willing to get people to try their linchpin ingredient that ties the steak and fries together. Relais also serves 2 portions of steak initially, then follows up with another portion of steak - meanwhile, Skirt Steak only serves the initial two portions (perfectly cooked, I recommend rare here), then does not allow for further portions. That second portion makes all the difference at the other restaurant, as it helps keep you satisfied in your appetite- here, I wanted more, but all I had were fries with no sauce and no meat :(. Other minor points are to add salt and pepper to the table - I actually wanted the salt for the fries, not the meat, but it felt trite to have to ask for these condiments at a steak restaurant of all places, where there will be a vast range of steak preferences from different patrons. Generally speaking, I really liked this place, and wanted it to succeed- it is succeeding too! I just know that other places with a very similar premise have features that make the dining experience there that much more satisfying. Keep up the good work, and I hope some of my critique takes root.",2023,summari good concept carbon copi french restaur chain relai de lentrecot notabl miss mark key element good restaur decor servic food top tier server larissa felt wait night thursday night wait minut thought perfect bustl restaur ambienc felt warm welcom love wooden column decor dessert select excel par nyc restaur good frankli im give restaur star concept relai de lentrecot charg extra bearnais felt slimi felt restaur stingi peopl linchpin ingredi tie steak fri relai serv portion steak initi portion steak skirt steak serv initi portion perfectli cook recommend rare portion portion make differ restaur help satisfi appetit want fri sauc meat minor point add salt pepper tabl want salt fri meat felt trite condiment steak restaur place vast rang steak prefer patron gener speak place want succeed succeed place similar premis featur make dine experi satisfi good work hope critiqu take root,0,0.9892

Skirt Steak,1,"I was going to write a review immediately after I came out from this place. My husband, a friend and I went to this place on Aug 12. We all had been wanting  to try this place for a while and that day was the day. So, a long line outside should be a good indicator, but once we were seated, the waiter gave us only the drunk list and start telling us in speed of a roadrunner of all items on the menu, not offering any other menu, not trying to tell us to look at the board above our table. Was he expecting us to remember the 1st item he mentioned when he finished his 15th items? Hellll no. He tried to upsell and maybe trying to use the confusion strategy to get peoplenot, mostly are tourists, to nod...get $$$$. Most importantly, if he had to talk that much trying to upset his items, he should have worn a mask. I know its not mandatory anymore for COVID. But there are other things beside COVID that come with the saliva. ....thats to me was the 1st red flag. So, we ended up getting their basic set. It started with the salad. A generous amount of salad which was unedible. We all had a bit or two and we put our fork down. It didnt look fresh. My husband and our friend said it was bitter. I said the veggies look old and the salad dressing is horrible. When the meat came with fries, the meat portion was smaller than what we expected, not like Les Venise steak house on Lexington. The fries was oily. So, we just finished the meat, paid and leave. Beside food, my husband ordered a coke, they brought Diet Coke. I normally would order an alcoholic drink and dessert when dinning out, but not this time. I dont feel like giving more money to support the poor services. I would give a 3 stars to one of the food runner...he did a great job in serving us and he should be promoted as a main waiter.",2023,write review immedi place husband friend place aug want place day day long line good indic seat waiter gave drunk list start tell speed roadrunn item menu offer menu board tabl expect rememb st item mention finish item hellll upsel confus strategi peoplenot tourist nod importantli talk upset item worn mask mandatori anymor covid thing covid saliva st red flag end basic set start salad gener amount salad uned bit put fork didnt fresh husband friend bitter veggi salad dress horribl meat fri meat portion smaller expect le venis steak hous lexington fri oili finish meat paid leav food husband order coke brought diet coke order alcohol drink dessert din time dont feel give money support poor servic give star food runner great job serv promot main waiter,-1,0.5168

Skirt Steak,4,We waited in line for about 2 hours.  We were seated and the service was fast.  Very fast which is not what you want when you go for dinner and felt rushed.  As there really is no menu you get your salad served immediately and steak comes a few minutes later.  Steak was good and portion was OK leaving you wanting more.  The fries are endless and nice and crispy but we did have to flag people down to get more instead of having the staff looking who wanted more.  Dessert is a cart which is not included in price and changes fast so if you see something you like get it as they may run out by the end of your dinner. I would go back as it was a nice quick bite and this is how this is designed.

Not to mention the meal was just okay. Fries were definitely on point, but I may have had a general taste of disgust from the disappointment in my mouth.

Skirt Steak,3,"I found this place on Yelp and had been to a place in London with the same concept, so I wanted to check it out. The menu only has one main item on it, which is steak. My friends and I came in at around 12 on a Saturday, as they do not accept reservations. We didnt have to wait but it was pretty packed at that time already. For drinks, I had the blackberry spritz, which wasnt bad. Fruity but not too sweet. The skirt steak ($28) comes with a side of au poivre (probably?) sauce, a salad, and unlimited fries. There are only three doneness options: well done, medium well, or rare. I usually get medium rare so I opted for the rare, which pretty much was like medium rare. The steak was pretty salty and chewy. It was kind of disappointing. The fries looked soggy but they actually taste better than it looks. The best part of the meal was probably the salad. Its a butter lettuce salad, though they were a bit heavy handed on the dressing. The steak looks small but I was struggling to finish towards the end, probably because 1. I ate a bunch of fries 2. Again, the steak was salty.

Cons: 1hr line minimum, small serving of steak, fries were okay Honestly food was pretty decent, steak was good not great imo. The pictures attached was for 2 servings. I was expecting more, but also understand considering the price. Fries were inconsistent, one batch was unsalted and I had to ask for salt, the next batch seemed to come from the depths of the ocean and I was shaking some off. Pros: Staff is very attentive and professional, has a real valuable steakhouse feel. Vibe is fun, people are in good spirits. Cant go wrong with $28 steak and fries. They dont let you go empty on the fries(in a nice way.) Staff is quick to grab empty plates and very friendly.

Skirt Steak,2,"I was very excited to dine here. The reviews seemed great. First off, there is NO two hour wait. On Saturday and Sunday the restaurant opens for brunch (same menu, with the addition of garlic bread for $12, and no option for bottomless drinks). The hours on those days are 11:30a-3p and the reopen at 5pm until closing (10/11p). Therefore, people made it during 3-5p and decided themselves to wait. Moving on. This was my second time here because of that. Our table had bread crumbs on it and the paper placemats had an oil stain. The waitress dusted it off but we had to ask the bus boy to replace the paper. Underneath had more crumbs and dirt and he threw the new mat over it. Unacceptable. Next, we were told buy a manager there was no Prosecco but the waitress said there was. When it was brought to the table it was flatter than fast food soda. Unacceptable. The server really tries to upcharge by selling you on $10 sides. But the food comes with 2 sides- my personal opinion is just to offer substitutions or $1 upcharge to switch it because you still get the salad + fries + extra side(s). My biggest issue was that this restaurant use PEANUT OIL to fry their fries AND you dont know until you ask. In a world full of allergies this should be readily disclosed. Unacceptable. *Disclamer- all the desserts, with the exception of the Chocolate cake, are made with NUTS* The meat is served Med Rare, Medium, and Well Done. What also went wrong was that 4 orders of meat came out severely undercooked when we asked for Medium. At this point I was turned off and no longer hungry. Our waitress started off very friendly but soon didnt show up to our table at all. The manager Savaah stopped by the table was was extremely personable. He spoke with us a little and apologized for the experience and welcomed us to dine their again in hopes we would change our minds. Because of his visit to the table and his generous offers we reconsidered. However, after reviewing it with my party we probably will not, not based on the experience but based on the food quality itself. The portion size for one is a 4-6 oz steak, a licorice flavored salad, and cold + burnt fries.

Skirt Steak,2,"Unfortunately this place is not quite worth the hype. 1.  The skirt steak:  you have ONE job, and it was kind of a mess.  Rare, medium and well are the only options.  We ordered 4 mediums and 1 rare, what we received was a hodge-podge of raw to medium-well, sometimes within one portion.  The waiter kindly offered to take some of the raw pieces back.  That sauce was tasty, and necessary to season the otherwise bland skirt steak. 2. The unlimited fries - so disappointing.  Overcooked and cold.  After the second refill of dry cold fries, we asked for a new batch, and the waiter finally brought us some hot fries. 3.  Dessert- key lime pie, with an unnecessary but,very dramatic looking, fluff tasting meringue was okay.  Thin slice of desserts not worth the $10 go to a local bakery instead. 4. Sides - never received the sides we ordered to yeah that happened. 5. Drinks - again save your money.  The non-alcoholic Cranberry Rosemary drink is simple syrup and seltzer with a tablespoon of cranberry juice. Another $10 wasted. 6.  Overall atmosphere- People literally kept their coats on because it was so cold.  Either this was done on purpose or a malfunctioning hvac system, either was it was horribly cold and drafty. The concept is great for marketing, but actual execution really missed the mark.

They had also asked if we would like a refill on fries but they never came back to provide the fries.

Skirt Steak,4,"First off, I want to say that this place is fun! The service is amazing, staff are fun, and the decor is homely and cute - the vibes are impeccable! Now for the food - I want to say that for the price of $28, the fixed meal does seem like a good deal. However, to start, they already give you a large portion of fries. Chances of you getting seconds for the bottomless fry deal are low, and if you did, youd probably say something like oh, just a little bit please. The steak itself is quite a small portion. In my pictures, unfortunately I was too hungry and forgot to take it before I started eating... but as you see on the hot plate, there are two spots of meat. Those were (before we began eating) two separate portions. Make of that what you will. Sides and dessert are extra charge, which is expected. For $28, the meal will definitely fill you up, just not necessarily on the steak. I love the sauce they serve with the steak, and the steak itself is cooked beautifully. I do want to mention though that as a whole, the meal was extremely salty for me. The seasonings are heavy - be it the salad, fries, or steak. The sides that we ordered, such as the Spinach gratin and potato/bacon side were also extremely salty. The only break I had was taking enormous gulps of water. The dessert on the other hand was wonderful.  Not too sweet, but still rich enough to make me feel like I was indulging in a dessert. I ordered the citrus cheesecake. I want to say that this place is worth the experience. The food is good and so is the atmosphere. Staff are so so friendly. However, if youre looking for a larger quantity of steak and perhaps just less of a sodium blast in general, you might as well buy a nice cut of ribeye or whatever you prefer, cook it up at home, and season to your liking. To me, it isnt worth waiting out in the cold for several hours like other reviews had mentioned. I arrived on a Thursday 20 minutes before opening and was seated promptly.

Skirt Steak,5,"Amazing that I got in with just 15 mins wait. I was told the best time to go if you want to AVOID the long queue (2 hrs  ) is to go during weekend lunch. If you are solo, ask for bar seats u might be able to get seated quicker. They don t take reservation unless it s party of 7 and up. You don t put ur name down anywhere bc there is no list, u just need to stand in line with ur complete party and inch up the line slowly. When u are next in line at the door, someone from inside will open the door and assist.  U will see many ppl trying to storm in to the hostess stand behind the door to put their name down, but the manager has his system in control and pushes back these ppl to go back in the line. It s definitely worth it, $28 u get a beautiful classic green salad w/ mixed herbs and vinaigrette, the skirt steak is served on a cast iron skillet with some kind of brown sauce (does not taste like peppercorn sauce), temp of the steak was well executed, juicy and a little bit of a biTe since it s skirt steak, the char from the grill was exactly what I was looking for, they served the unlimited fries from a big bowl, the server was walking around the dining room offering fries refill. Ambience was great, lively and bustling, interior design looks like a cedar wood chalet which is a bit of a disconnect imo. There were sides of the day available for around $10-$12, and we ordered the spinach gratin which was great! I heard some days they have potato gratin as an option too.

Skirt Steak,2,"Came into Skirt Steak on a Wednesday night. Party of four and we waited around a half an hour. The hostess was nice and got us seated relatively quickly. When we sat, we were greeted by our waiter. It was explained to us that there are three ways to cook the steak, either rare, medium, or well done - and that the meal comes with unlimited fries and salad to start. He brought us some still water and asked us if wed like bread to start - he said yes. When we were brought the bread, there were 6 pieces for 4 people. Not to mention the fact that nobody ever mentioned wed be charged $10 for BREAD. I thought this was an extremely predatory sales tactic, but whatever. Then, the salads came. Everybody at the table had salad that was way too bitter to eat. At first, we thought it was the dressing, but after asking for another salad with the dressing on the side, we noticed the lettuce was inedible - it was too bitter to eat. Upon further inspection, we noticed that the lettuce had to have been spoiled. As a waiter of 3 years myself, I have never heard one account of lettuce being spoiled or bitter  Then, we asked for an order of bread for the table and again were given not even enough for 4 people to eat two slices of bread. When we asked for more, we were told wed be charged, even though we were charged the $10 for the bread initially AND we didnt eat any salad. Not to mention the fact that they dont have any salad dressing OTHER than ONE SINGLE vinaigrette, or the fact that the only real dipping sauce they have for their unlimited fries is ketchup, mayo, and siracha. Almost $40 a person without the dessert and I cant eat my fries with BBQ sauce or my salad with caesar dressing. Next, the meat was brought. The only highlight of the meal and the only reason Im giving this experience a two star. I was very upset because I asked for my meat medium, and more on the pink side if possible, and the waiter just nodded his head and never made sure my meat was pink. The unlimited fries that came with my meal became cold within seconds - indicating that fries were not fresh. On top of everything, during sitting for a 2-hour meal, our fries were replenished twice. The meat was OKAY. Nothing to write home about, but at least I got something filling that I could eat throughout all of this. On top of everything, our waiter checked on us once after getting our orders - thats it. We were served primarily by the busboys. I wish I could say this was the end of my experience, but it wasnt. We asked to split the bill four ways and the waiter told me that the machine doesnt do this. I dont understand how thats possible? As someone who has operated an OS responsible for a restaurant, and as someone who has easily split checks 3 ways - I knew this was a lie. The waiter did not attempt to be helpful at all, and instead insisted we only give him 2 cards. I understand that running a restaurant costs money, but when youre paying $5 for a slim glass of Coca-Cola that PERHAPS houses a half a can, or when youre charging $10 for bread [unheard of], at least make sure your computers [in 2022] are capable of paying checks. The funniest part to me is that the waiter came up to the table with his hands behind his back, asked us if we were ready for the check, and when we said yes, he pulled the check out and handed it to us - absolutely rushing to get us out of the restaurant to flip the table. Lets recount my experience: -30 minute wait, inedible salad, predatory sales tactics [selling bread for $10?], no real help from my waiter, meat not cooked to my liking, the only time the waiter showed us any real attention was to get his tip, no sauces, no dressings other than ONE shallot vinagrette At least the fries were good though, right?

Skirt Steak,3,"I had heard good things and really wanted to try this place so went with a few friends. Overall it was decent but I dont think it lived up to the hype. We went for dinner on a Saturday night, and they dont take reservations we aimed for 6PM and a friend got there earlier and in total we ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs to be seated, and this is after we jumped at the chance for bar seats over a table. As for the value at $29 for the pre-fixe salad, skirt steak and all you can eat fries it is amazing. Also, for a steak house I was surprised by the beer selection, it was not generic and was quite nice. However, the good for me ends there ... First, the steak... It was alight but in my opinion just lacked flavor even with the bechamel sauce they provided I felt myself wanting more. I probably would have covered it in A1 if they offered it, that is how little flavor it had. As for the fries they were ok but were nothing to write home about.

Skirt Steak,5,"Unlimited fries. Now I have your attention, Skirt Steak offers a high-quality dinner at an affordable price. The entree selection is reduced to one item and the dining experience is friendly and efficient. This isnt the Gallaghers or Keens steakhouse treatment, but youll leave Skirt Steak content and happy. Detailed review below: Skirt Steak first presented me an interior gabled with a barn like framing bathed in warm light. Inviting and friendly are both the aesthetic and the staff. When walking to my table there was an energy in the air as other diners ate, conversed, and enjoyed their meal. Great ambiance. The table was adorned with neatly folded napkins nestling card stock menus. Utensils and cups befittingly positioned. The surface was covered in a paper place setting with the words: Greens, Skirt Steak, Fries / $28 stamped on the corners. This simple mantra is the basis of simple elegance. I glanced once again around the room and appreciated the rustic design. Even the speakers were made of light-colored wood to match the framing. Their menu is clean and easy to read with a spartan grouping of wines, beer, cocktails, and dessert. The wine and beer arrays are diverse enough to satisfy most palates while the cocktail selection offers riffs on a few classics. The titular Skirt Steak is offered in only three temperatures: rare, medium, and well. I ordered a Skirt Manhattan and a rare steak with spinach. Bread arrived before the meal with soft spreadable butter. The bread had a firm crust with a soft interior while the butter was rich and salted. The Skirt Manhattan was textbook; spirit forward with just enough vermouth to cut the harshness of the whiskey. The default green of the meal was a small salad of raw leafy veggies with herbs and a marinade. It tasted of fennel and dill drizzled with olive oil and a dash of lemon. I must say the salad is underrated. It brought a freshness to the experience and prepared me for the heavier main course. The steak was crusted on the exterior and served sliced on a griddle exposing the pink center. Fries were thin, crispy, and well salted. On its own, the steak was properly seasoned and the combination of the textures was lovely. There was a sauce which appeared to be bearnaise served on the side. I can only describe the sauce as culinary napalm as it was so viscous it could stick to anything and make it fire. Spinach was tender and flavorful. Unlimited fries sounds amazing but in the big picture the meal is so complete the unlimited fries are more of a novelty than a necessity. The star of the dinner was the dessert. I did not expect to be blown away as I do not have a sweet tooth but when the dessert cart rolled to the table, I knew I was in for a treat. The elaborate glass and wood chest matched the rustic aesthetic of the restaurant and emitted an aura as if it was the arc of the covenant. My table ordered a few pastries. The flan is the best Ive ever had, I still yearn for the chocolate tart with berries, and the paris-brest was delicate and decadent. My only complaint with both the desert and the restaurant is that they did not serve coffee. Seems like an unfortunate oversight as coffee would have enhanced the wonderful dessert. Overall skirt steak delivers a high-quality meal at an affordable price with excellent service in a relaxed yet stylish atmosphere.

Skirt Steak,5,"Master of One Its better to have one item on the menu done perfectly than to have a large menu of poorly executed dishes. I present to you @skirtsteak.nyc, the eponymously named restaurant known for serving only Skirt steak. There is only 1 thing on their menu which is conveniently printed on the left hand corner of table. $28 for the full course menu. Consisting of a field green salad, skirt steak and endless handmade fries. Upon being seated the waiter took our drink order and gave us a basket of bread, which was great. It had a crunchy crust with fluffy soft inside that paired great with butter. It was simply great bread. The field green salad is adequate, its a salad. The greens are fresh and earthy/herby in flavor, I cant remember if there was dressing but then again this is a salad at a steak restaurant its not suppose to be memorable. I managed to finish it, my brother did not. The skirt steak, the star of the show, arrived shortly after we were done with our salads. And cooked perfectly to the temperature requested (medium rare). The outside had a nice sear and the overall steak was extremely flavorful and tender. I didnt know skirt steak would be done this well. It is also served with like a garlic butter sauce, I tried a piece with the sauce but honestly it wasnt needed. The steak is great on it own. Instead use that sauce for the endless fries. The endless fries are served alongside the steak and yes its truly endless, as soon as you empty the bowl they bring a refill, until you ask them to stop. And the fries are also top-notch; crispy and fresh. So good that we had 3 refills. The menu also has a changng number of  daily sides ($9) that waiter will introduce. We went with the cauliflower gratin which was just a cheesy cauliflower delight! And last and certainly not least they have an amazing dessert cart that gets pushed out after you finish and do yourself a favor, order dessert. I had this amazing hazelnut flavor dream of a dessert and I forget what my brother ordered. I wish I could remember the name of it but instead I used that limited space in my memory to just remember that taste of that dessert.

The server of the fries (some guy who walks around with a bowl of fries and tongs) spilled fries in my glass of water, and I was never offered a new cup.

Once you sit down, you re presented with a drink menu, but no food menu it s printed on your table! $28 for bread, salad, skirt steak, and unlimited fries. It s an awesome deal and you won t leave hungry. The salad was large and had a delicious dressing, and was served with fresh baguette and butter. Ask for the garlic bread (if they still have any they tend to run out as the night goes on). After salad, they bring over your steak, which can be cooked rare, medium, or well done (we found the medium to be closest to medium rare, if that s what you re looking for). The skirt steak is served with a really great sauce as well as unlimited French fries (they ll come around and ask you if you want more!) For anyone that isn t familiar with skirt steak, it s become increasingly popular (and expensive) over the past few years and is prized for its tenderness and great flavor. You can also get a side of some vegetables (they had spinach and Brussels sprouts when we went, the spinach was great), though that s an additional charge on top of the base $28.

When I asked if I could just sit at the bar, they hedged back and forth and finally said yes. I learned this would soon be a consistent approach as I was sat by the door, overhearing others come in. Each person coming in was given wildly different answers as they came in. The red-headed bartender (never shared her name) was initially alone behind the bar, so we cut her some slack. However absolute disinterest was the only thing she served us without an exorbitant wait. Were talking 20+ minutes for a requested water refill. We ordered our food after sitting there more than 30 minutes, and bread and salad came pretty quickly. Standard, boring, Golden Corral level of fare. It then took over 45 minutes after the salads to get out steaks. I finally asked the bartender because two people that had come in an hour after us got their food first. She went to the kitchen, and clearly our steaks had been given to others at the bar. The steak itself was cooked well temperature wise for medium. It was crusted with so much salt, I assume to try and tenderize it, that it was nearly inedible. The fries were hit or miss, with half of them being oily and soggy.

A family got seated behind us a little while later and had a manager taking their order I think, and he was explaining that there was other side dishes & an option of a burger? Our server only asked us how we want the steak cooked and never mentioned anything else. Everyone seems all over the place and just unsure. Dessert cart is a great idea, never seen anything like it.

Skirt Steak,4,"5 stars for the food. 3 stars for the service. TLDR; good food, go early, be prepared to wait for fry refills Everything we had was delicious! In addition to the steak, fries, and salad, we added on the garlic bread ($9) and two desserts (key lime pie and chocolate mouse for $9 each) and would recommend all three. Blackberry spritz was good but they were out of the spices for the spiced margarita so I ordered a regular margarita which I would not recommend. We arrived at around 4:30pm (on a Friday) and there was no line so we took a walk around the block. When we came back at around 4:45, a line had started to form and it grew quickly. We were seated around 5:15 or so which wasn t bad at all but I can t imagine being at the end of that line as it obviously moved slower once the tables filled up. So definitely go early if you want to avoid a long wait as the line was even longer when we left. (They don t take reservations for parties under seven people). While we enjoyed the food, they would need to sort out some of the service issues before we return. Our server was nice (no complaints there) but we had to wait close to 30+ minutes for them to refill the fries at our table and by the time they had brought the second round of fries, my steak was then cold.

My only complaint is that they tried pushing drinks on us too much, but otherwise the service was top notch.",2022,day open great start warm bread sizabl salad unlimit shoestr fri good portion steak steak nice char remain perfectli tender convinc order pari brest dessert enjoy complaint push drink servic top notch,1,0.926
Skirt Steak,5,"Skirt Steak is unbelievably good. Unlimited hand cut, house made french fries, perfectly crisped and golden brown. Service is extremely quick and all the staff is extremely friendly. The atmosphere is very inviting and the entire restaurant feels very open and pleasant. The beer list is quite varied and feels curated quite well to pair with the meal. The first item to come out is the baguette served with sea salt butter. It was still warm when it came out, and absolutely delicious. The next is the salad, which has a delicious vinaigrette on it. Then the generous serving of steak comes out, which is cooked to absolute perfection. It comes served with bearnaise sauce on the side, which has peppercorns and tarragon. French fries are offered from serving bowl with unlimited refills! The next surprise was the dessert cart, which offered a wide selection of fantastic desserts. The Paris-brest was the best I have ever had, and the pannacotta was light and delicious! This is a very fairly priced meal and absolutely delicious.
