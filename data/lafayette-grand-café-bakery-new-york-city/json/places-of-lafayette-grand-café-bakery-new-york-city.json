There were only 4 people ahead of me, but as I was waiting, the line did get longer behind me. The cafe people seemed aggravated that the cafe patrons were blocking the doorway, which I could understand if they actually had customers coming in; but there was literally no one going to the cafe the whole time I was there; so the rudeness seemed unnecessary. Ended up getting the monthly special - the oui love oishii supreme. The strawberry and yuzu flavors sounded interesting; but the yuzu jam-like filling actually didnt work for me with this pastry. The strawberry frosting on top actually did work, and I wished there was more of this and less of the yuzu stuff. The pastry itself as nice a flaky. Id probably give the chocolate a try at some time, and quite the pastry itself was pretty decent, its definitely would not be worth waiting in a long line for.",

The beef duo with short ribs and filet was good but a bit overpriced compared to the duck. Cocktails are great too, they were strong and delicious. Their service however is far inferior compared to the food. The waiter was distracted, spilled a good amount of water on the table on two occasions, and paid a lot more attention to the man at the table than the woman. Had they not messed up the service it would have been a solid 5 star experience.",

I remember trying a coworkers when her boyfriend waited 2 hours with another friend to get her 2. I decided to finally get one myself during extremely bad weather and braved the storm. No line which was amazing! I wouldn t wait longer than 15 min, especially in the cold. The pistachio one had hints of extract, which I m not too big a fan of. The chocolate had an almost alcoholic like flavor filling, with basically dark chocolate icing on top. The croissant outer shell was amazing, I honestly think that alone is worth trying. Very very crispy and flakey. Overall, however I probably wouldn t go out of my way again. Great bakery and if I were in the neighborhood, I would likely come back to try the other baked goods.",

The lines can be a bit long though - if you are there for the cafe, you can just skip the line and talk to the hostess. The croissants can run out, so come soon after they are baked (which is apparently at 8am, 12pm, and 4pm). We got in line at 1:30,am and got our croissants at 2pm. By that time, they were out of most flavors and only at 12 croissants left!",

The 3 flavors available at the time: chocolate, pistachio, and strawberry. I tried the pistachio one. It was filled with pistachio cream, very sweet, flaky, and good enough portion for one person. While it was easy to procure a croissant, and find a seat, the price point wasn t enticing. One croissant costed $10.34 (with tax), which is not at all cheap or common for a croissant. Also tried their Mocha with plant based milk, which costed an additional $9 (with tax). While the ambiance and croissant is good, this is an overly expensive place IMO.",

I can t deny this vday limited supreme is cuter than their regular ones. The croissant is huge - share one with your friend so you pay $5 each, girl math. Oishii Berry is expensive, so you can also convince yourself paying more for good strawberries. 2. How long did I wait? 10 mins before they started selling the last batch (4pm) on a Friday. Don t waste your time if the line is too long. If you have never tried Lafayette s viral croissants and been wanting to try for the hell of it, go ahead. The hype is dying down. You never go wrong with Oishii Berry, and this collab is 100% instagrammable. Oui Love Oishii Supreme We read many bad reviews about their supremes, but this February special went beyond our expectations. The pink white chocolate top glaze was overly sweet so we scraped it off. The two Koyo berries were good but much smaller irl. Mediocre croissant - it was neither buttery nor flaky, perhaps that s how their supreme maintains the perfectly round shape. Yuzu creme was right up my alley, very creamy and citrusy; while the Koyo berry compote tasted fresh and natural, unlike some sickly sweet jam with artificial flavoring. The two components were good seperately but didn t really complement with one another.",

Hostess was so rude, when i asked what was the ETA she told me their priorities were larger parties. So you shouldn t go there with your significant other or just another friend, since they dont care about 2 people tables. Popular croissants area works independently from the restaurant and even if you have a reservation and table booked, you still have to get your place in the huge line, and order separately, since you can NOT order it through the restaurant menu. Croissant through the restaurant menu is very dry with dried up chocolate (which chocolate you can barely find). Overpriced sandwich had overcooked egg, unknown origin ham, and croissant was very very soft like brioche so was not even croissant. Server was nice at least and atmosphere was still nice.",

We came 5 minutes before reservation last Sunday for brunch, and were sitted just in 20 minutes of additional wait, that was annoying. The food menu was really not impressive and had only old classics like eggs Benedict and pancakes. Very small portions, my eggs Benedict were ok, shakshuka was bland. Drinks were ok. Asked to order one of the famous round croissants to the table and they rejected, told us to go to the counter and order there. Alright, decided to pick them up on the way out, BUT they didn t let us in the line in the building and said we need to go outside and wait in the line there, even though we just dined with them! That was a no thanks for me. Overall it s not worth the hype",

I am glad I got the chance to try them finally. My friends and I also had brunch there. We made reservations through their website. Couple of us were running late due to weekends train issues, and they let us move our reservations from 12pm to 12:30pm without any problem. Which is great. I wanted to try the mocha but I didn t want it to be too strong or too sweet. When I told the server that, he was telling me to order something else. Lol so I ordered cappuccino. Egg Benedict is my usual go to for brunch. And they had one with smoked salmon. I normally don t like it because the smoke salmon doesn t always taste good to me. But I liked it at this place. The restaurant was packed and crowded. Their sitting arrangement needs little work. It s not spacious and cramped. But good food, even though it is on the pricy side. (Egg Benedict is $32. Cappuccino I think $6.25). I would recommend it.",

There are plenty of recommendations, I would think that everything you could try would be 10/10 so the only recommendation worth the redundancy, for your experience to be perfect, is to go as early as possible so that: 1. The wait is as short as possible, since it is a trendy place that is always packed (We arrived at 8:00am for breakfast and only waited 5 minutes) 2. So that they dont run out (friends who tried to go in the afternoon, queued for 1 hour and when they were close to English they ran out of their iconic stuffed croissants)",

They boot you outside in the cold, and if theyre out of their famous donuts, they send you to the back of the line, even if youve been waiting for ages. The donuts were ready just some minutes after my turn, and they still wouldnt let me have em. Seriously, not the vibe you want from a place like this. Becoming famous and being respectable isnt just about being good; its like having the talent and adding exceptional customer service to the mix   thats the real deal. Such a shame!",

This was repeated at 3 other tables after we were told we could not order the pastries at the table. So you can sit down and have a coffee in the morning, but you cannot have their famous croissant as you cannot order it to the table. You can buy a croissant but not sit down to eat it for breakfast. -they only serve brunch on the weekend -in the middle of December 1 of the 2 hostesses wanted to send me out of the establishment to wait in the queue outside for the pastries.then I told her there was no queue. Only then did she go to check and confirmed I can stay inside. 2 hostesses on a Tuesday lunch time and 1 was mainly for the pastries and could not even pay attention to those people -the servers at the bakery were way too slow especially that the queue can get long quite often. This place is so fake french its blood boiling. The pastries however were amazing. But not good enough to make up for this terrible business setup.PLUS for that price theyd better be good",

Was with family and purchased a lot of pastries ($100+) and was denied an outside table when they weren t in use, as they were  dine in  tables. There were 2 customers using them and no line. Policy made no sense, and we had to eat elsewhere as the pastry / to go tables were occupied. I was waiting in line for the pastry / cafe side. The line merged into one as there was only 1 employee, so it became 2 big line. After waiting and it was almost my turn it split into a pastry and cafe line again and I had to redo the pastry line once more. I waited in 3 lines for 30 minutes. The food is pretty good, but the customer service is really poor and there is no structure inside. It s really on the fly and they just support each other. Can t really get upset at the employees as they are just following policies even if they don t make sense.",

We waited in the line for over 25 minutes (which was fine) but the staff member who was outside was rude and kept disappearing and never gave straight answers about what happens next. We decided to just go into the bakery because there were no further instructions on how long it would take. We then found out that there was another long line inside that nobody outside was aware of. Everybody was just waiting outside in the cold expecting the line to move as per what the staff member told us. The  famous  croissant was mediocre at the best. If you re carving out time from your busy schedule just for trying it, I d strongly suggest that you skip it and go to a cafe that actually respects the customers that keeps their business alive. Lafayette bakery does not value its customers and will not have a successful business for too long. *Rant over*",

But I passed by it in the morning and saw a very short line, so I had to try it out, and it was fully worth the short wait. The circular shape is more than a gimmick. It exposes all the layers equally to the hot air in the oven, resulting in an even crunch. The crispy shell and velvety filling complemented each other. The custard was on the sweeter side, but it became the right amount of sweetness with the plain croissant dough. Overall, highly recommended as long as the line is very short.",

On my first attempts later in the day, they were already sold out. I was fortunate enough to finally get the pumpkin and pistachio flavors. I wouldnt say I disliked them, but its definitely a one-time experience for me. Usually, complaints are about too little filling, but this time, they were quite generous with the cream   almost too much! Im not kidding, I found myself enjoying the second half of the croissant after squeezing out some of the filling. The taste is good, but its incredibly sweet.",

We ordered both the pistachio and the chocolate and they were both fantastic. My favorite of the two was the pistachio so make sure to try it out. We also ordered coffee and it was great. We chose to take our items to go, but there were tables inside and outside if you wanted to eat your goodies at the restaurant. I loved theres a separate entrance and counter area foe the bakery and ordering to go so the crowds do not interfere with the other diners. The service was so great and I want to come back and eat in the main part of thr restaurant because all the food looks and smells so appealing.",

Their bakery is tiny, but the taste is certainly mighty. The seasonal round croissants are consistently sold out. Line is long at times but worth the wait and calories. But what I love and dream about, is their Frisee Salad with Lardon and poached egg. All I can say is wow wow wow!! I can boast about the French Onion soup and the yummy bread/butter service too. Those are my usual lunch items but I also do enjoy their brunch item, Croque Monsieur. C est Magnifique!!",

Admittedly, it was an unconventional choice for me, but it proved to be a revelation. The buttery layers melded harmoniously with the rich, nutty pistachio, elevating this to the pinnacle of croissant desserts I ve ever savored. Following this act was the cinnamon cronut, which was very good in its own right, with its sweet, spiced layers offering a satisfying crunch. However, it was overshadowed by the sheer excellence of the croissant wheel. Lafayette Bakery has crafted a lineup where even their standard offerings shine, but if you have to choose, the croissant wheel with pistachio is an absolute must-try. Its not just a pastry; its an experience that leaves a lasting impression.",

We researched about the bakery etc. We were the first in line at 7am and knew the Bakery and Restaurant opened at 8am. We also understood that bakery items could not be ordered from table service. 8am came and went with no communication to the line that had formed. We finally approached asking when the Bakery would open at 8:07am and were informed they were delayed and it would be a few more moments. My husband stayed in line while I went to sit at the table. I observed 3 new training servers starting on a Saturday. Our server was the same gentleman who we approached at the door. He took our order and mid-way through our service disappeared to man the bakery, no communication just left the training server to check on Us. It is clear this establishment has been challenged with staffing and communication is not their forte. Food was mediocre and overpriced. The Supreme Croissants were good but we have had better in Boston. Overall a complete let down to the hype. Would not recommend.",

They also seemed staler vs. if you got one fresh baked in the morning. Even so, I didn t find anything special about the flavors or texture that would bring me back. Additionally, the lady manning the line just put a damper on the experience. We were yelled at to line up single file and were told to move to the side when there was no movement in the line ahead of us or anywhere else for that matter. The only pro was we were able to buy a couple more than 1x per person.",

The service in the bakery was not very friendly. My card, for some reason, didnt work here (although it works everywhere else), and the guy kept pressing me to pay. Not very pleasant.",

It never came. My husband and I agreed it was awful. The place is large and the help is cordial, but we agreed it was the worst French meal weve had in NY.",

You can only be seated if you say you are going to eat brunch or get a cocktail. I said I would buy a drink to get a seat and I was constantly being asked if I was gonna order food even if I had just bought their bakery goods. They made me feel so uncomfortable. Keep in mind I made line to get the filled crossiants and asked if we could eat it inside and the worker said yes. I legit had to say i was getting a cocktail to be seated and once i sat down i got a coffee instead (which i didnt finish) and ended up leaving 10 min in . Coffee was bad and the crosiants were not good at all . Not worth the wait or money. Just the hype of the pictures.",

                "review_text": "Visiting this bakery was a painfully disappointing experience. The service provided was deplorable, characterized by staff who seemed to wear their rudeness as a badge of honor. Simple amenities like napkins were noticeably absent from the tables, leaving guests scrambling and helpless in maintaining a clean and enjoyable dining atmosphere. Finding the restroom turned into an unintentional game of hide and seek, with zero signage to guide the way and staff too discourteous to assist. When inquiring about the location, the response received was not directions but instead, an undeserved bout of yelling. Moreover, the glaring absence of service personnel on the floor meant that getting assistance or asking questions turned into a daunting challenge. The only semblance of kindness and professionalism could be traced back to the bar staff, who unfortunately seemed overwhelmed and unable to manage the floor. My experience reached its nadir when I, unable to locate a trash receptacle and finding no staff to assist, left my leftovers on a waiters station. This action was met with public humiliation as a waiter - a rude, middle-aged, heavyset man - decided the appropriate response was to yell across the cafe, attracting the unwanted attention of all present. Though I apologized, the sting of embarrassment and the bitter taste of regret lingered far longer than it should have. Date & hour of visit: 3 Oct, 10:00 AM. This bakery is a minefield of unprofessionalism and a gallery of how-not-to-treat-customers. If being treated like refuse is on your agenda, by all means, step in. Otherwise, consider any and all alternatives as a better choice for your patronage. This establishment not only failed to meet the basic standards of hospitality but seemed to actively disdain them. Consider yourself warned.",

If you are interested on ordering the famous Supreme croissant, you are not allowed to order it from your table. You need to do a big line, what sounds ridiculous. By the way, avoid big lines for that, you can find better croissants at many bakeries in NYC without such a big line.

As simple as that. Order a brunch item for 20-30$, you can order one item from the bakery. I can t stress on how many people I heard complain about this policy in the 2 hours I was there. Service is bad. The server is just mean and unhappy. He was even yelling at one of the other servers going through training. I eventually got a chance, on a different day, to get the  famous  croissants. The chocolate is good but the pistachio is horrible.

The menu had become very pretentious. My 13 year old stepdaughter could not find anything she liked, which the waiters said was a common problem with youth who dine there. I was very disappointed.",

The cream filling was too greasy, sweet and heavy, and the pistachio flavor was almost non-existing because of the heavy cream and the plain, sticky sweet taste. Of course I wasn t expecting a refreshing pastry, but the cream was just too much and too boring. The croissant would taste much better if the cream was lighter, fluffy and less sweet. I ve had better and cheaper ones. The supreme croissant is overpriced and definitely not worthy of the waiting time (if you need to wait).",

As a visitor, I stood in the original line to order, but moved on to the cashier,  thinking that I was in the wrong line and order through the cashier.

I have to be more thankful to the staff here as they were responsible in shipping my lost wallet with all my ID cards which I missed at their restaurant . They mailed us the wallet was found after almost 10 days & helped us in shipping it to our address . Felt so happy and thank you every one in person who was responsible in this good act .

You can make yourself a better meal at home. It s so ridiculously over priced, they asked if we wanted sparkling or still water and we said still, assuming it s still would be tap water, then charged us $9 for it. We asked for the omelette without ham and the waiter asked us if we would like mushrooms in it instead of ham so we said yes thinking it s a replacement instead of the ham, but they charged an extra $4 for the 2 mushrooms they added in. There are way better bakeries and brunch spots in NYC",

While we waited, I decided to order a turkey croissant sandwich - not a fan. It was very dry. I ended up throwing it away. As for the croissant, I got the Pain Au Chocolat Supreme.

The baked items, brunch and lunch there is no contest the food alone is worth coming. We came recently as repeat customers on a weekend to try the baked goods and our mistake came too late in the morning so a lot of things were out. Truly the hype from social media I feel has caused a long line to form early and at certain times of the day you are supposed to get on line in order to get the baked items that are so hyped up- not sure how anyone would know that before coming so when we came and asked the staff was less than helpful and cold offering what was left (which was still phenomenal) and had quite the NY attitude providing the information we were not in the know. Still worth coming to for meals but just some feedback on the friendliness",

We open at 8 in the morning and from a quarter to ten there are no longer such croissants for sale. Come again at 12 and then there will be hundreds of these for sale again. I recommend the cinnamon crepe which was the best Ive eaten to date and at a very high level of craftsmanship and dough. I recommend the pistachio and blueberry rolled croissant. One is definitely enough because the cream inside is very rich!! I also recommend the torn bread with the olives. You can eliminate one of these easily by the evening... come and definitely enjoy a place on the pilgrimage!!",

This is a bakery as well they could comp it or just charge marginally more for the entrees and include it. We did order bread one time and we were charged several dollars and given the equivalent of 3 small pieces for two people. Very petty.",

Now i know they re known for their croissants and people say it s overhyped- but trust me when i say it is 100% worth it, for 10 dollars I d say is a more than fair bargain for the creamiest sweetest croissant you ve ever had, i ve tried both the chocolate and pistachio but personally loved the pistachio one more. The creamy, and smooth texture of the pistachio is to die for, especially with the nuts on top of the croissant, takes you to paradise. I d also recommend getting their after school special and splitting it with a friend, it s a very light and soft cookie that fulfills your sweet tooth but also you don t feel bad after  eating it",

We got there and there was a line and I m like this should be worth it. 20 minutes later the line didn t move 1 person?! What s going on?! The line behind us became huge, but they are not letting anybody in!! Finally we got in. I looked around and the restaurant/ bakery have only few tables full! We walked to counter to order croissants to go. I wanted to try a couple since I waited that long! The lady that works their said NO its 1 croissant per person! What! Why! Anyways my friends and I ended up getting 1 each and split them. Honestly nothing special at allllll. It s a social media hype that s all. We paid 10$ for each croissant. Which is very expensive and I literally had better ones in a gas station in Italy!!! For 3 euros and you can buy as many as you want and you don t have to wait for an hour!!! The only difference that these are round. If you are willing to waist your money and time for such a round joke!? Go for it. Never    again for me.",

The cheese, caramelized onions, dijon mustard, pickles & buttery bun melts in your mouth. I usually don t order burgers at restaurants but this was amazing. On the way out I stopped at the bakery. I picked up the almond cherry cake & strawberry crunch donut. They both were both good decisions. The cake was sweet & moist. You can taste the almond & cherry in every bite. The donut was soft & crunchy at the same time because of the strawberry crumbles. This place is worth the hype & every cent.",

Disgusting and late food, mid atmosphere, and rude understaffed servers that made an overall insulting and humiliating experience for my entire family that ruined our trip to NYC this Summer. Here are the details. The Asian girl server was so rude taking our order, and had us wait for about an hour until we checked with another server (bc she never came to check on us), just to hear that our order was never put in. We were so mad but we re-ordered since we wanted to try the Benedict. And about ten minutes later, the manager told us that the Kitchen used all of the Hollandaise sauce for the day and that we have to put in a different order. Almost an hour after we arrived at the place, we ordered medium well steak and rare tuna salad. Which we waited for ANOTHER HOUR. We waited for a total of two hours waiting for one of the worst steaks I ve ever had   too salty, all I taste is pepper salt, red as rare, tasteless and chewy to the point where my jaw ached. Got there at 10:30, left at about 1:20 with a day ruined. And the worst part is that the manager put the bill on the house, yet, never got a single apology from the Asian server that took our order in the first place, and all the other staff who gave us an attitude and words saying  don t bother since we are paying , as well as a Spanish worker who laughed at us and mocked us when we were leaving the restaurant with disappointment. Servers don t have their designated table sections, which means we had to talk to over five servers before getting our disappointing first food after two hours. Will never recommend to my fellows and will share this disappointing experience forever. Want to give zero star if possible.",

The pastries were already made, but the bakery staff was super slow in completing the order. As for the supremes, they were amazing. The filling elevates the pastry. Im not certain without the filling, this would be good enough.",

They have gelatin made out of seaweed so it s perfect for those who are vegetarian or cannot eat pork. They have their croissant drops at 8am, 12pm, and 4pm everyday. If you go during a weekday at 8am, you ll never have to wait in line for long. 12pm drops Monday- Thursday also don t have you waiting long. Their smoked salmon sandwich is delicious and you can sit inside or outside to enjoy your treats. I come back everytime I can.",

Probably good for local standards but not up to French or Switzerland standards. I had much better ones and the best one i had so far is Pain au Chocolat from Villars Fribourg Switzerland. Definitely i would not stand in line for 50 minutes again to get only one. Note: my review is not for the restaurant.",

The chocolate flavor had a chocolate flavor custard inside, and I personally prefer a harder and less sweet filling, it felt too big for one, def can split in two. I also didn t like the croissant to custard ratio, too much custard too little pastry. Even if it was $5 I would not repurchase for that reason, although I wonder if pistachio one would be better. Worth the hype if you want to post it on insta, for eating there is better stuff for less moneys.",

Also, HEADS UP: get there EARLY* Their line forms rather quickly. I got there around 8:30am and there were at least 20 ppl already in line. But DONT WORRY, the line moves along rather quickly. This location is easy to find by foot/uber/public transit, etc..This is also an eat-in Cafe displaying a great layout; with a wise way to split the dine-ins from take-outs. They offer indoor and outdoor seating (perfect for warm days*). Great staff, both very kind and thorough.  I went for the croissants, but being there..I saw so many other delicious-looking options!! I left with 2 of each croissant flavor.. Lafayette did NOT disappoint. You cant find some of these pastries just anywhere. I am definitely looking forward to revisiting this Bakery when I am back in New York. And by the way, its New York. Plan ahead. Expect a line. Expect to please your taste buds as well.",

Thus when I planned my NY trip this place was on my list , after landing I went to this cafe for breakfast (around 9am) and got to know all round croissants were sold out, I was very disheartened. And as I reserved the place , had to order breakfast without round croissants. The coffee was good and granola with berries was average and of decent quantity. Again I made an attempt next day & reached there at starp 8am (thats the opening time). I was surprised to see already people were waiting in queue, however I got my turn and another surprise was one person can get only one croissant thus could only try 2 flavours and absolutely loved it.. These croissants are so perfect and it would not be exaggerating if I say these are pieces of art , art of baking.. If you are in NY or visiting you must try these for sure.",

Ive had the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, the bacon maison, and scrambled eggs. Drink wise, the coffee could be better, however the hyper c and French rose were great! Why the lost a star? Theyre known for the speciality crossaints, however I think its ridiculous that Id have to stand in a long line just to order it when im going to be sitting for breakfast. Youd think there would be an option to at least order at the end of my meal as a to go option. The place is really nice, but if youre there for breakfast & speciality croissant, maybe come in a pair so that one of you can secure a table while the other waits on line.",

First of all, the check in for our table was very unpleasant. Two ladies at the reception were just discussing some issues about their booking system and ignored me who stood right in front of them. After we finally got seated, the server for our table basically just walked around and succeeded in avoiding all the eye contacts I tried to make. (I needed to order drinks). Overall, I feel the staff here are just very UNPROFESSIONAL! I know it s a busy brunch place but come on, they can do better. Besides, the croissants are just OKAY. They don t deserve you waiting in line for two hours. The dough is on the hard side and the pistachio filling is not flavorful enough (taste like basic custard). If there s no line, you can try them. Otherwise, don t feel bad about not able to get one.",

It fills up when the filled rolls come out in the Bakery part. The lines that form to buy them are unbelievable and they leave in a short time. Go early. They bake them at 8, 12 and 4 p.m. In addition to being super fashionable, they are truly spectacular! There are other takeaways that are very worth trying.",

                "review_text": "Despite the considerable efforts the business owner/manager put into creating a pleasant dining experience, our visit to this cafe was unfortunately marred by the behavior of one particular server. Our encounter with Jose, our assigned waiter, left much to be desired in terms of courtesy and professionalism. From the onset, Jose interrupted our initial waitress, who was already attending to our table, only to embark on an unsolicited lecture about the distinctions between still and tap water after a simple request for water. Such unnecessary condescension left a negative impression. Moreover, when my mother inquired about the various types of croissants available, Jose responded by curtly suggesting she approach the bakery stand and ask the question herself. A more accommodating response could have involved acknowledging the available options, such as chocolate, pistachio, and traditional, while advising her to verify their availability at the bakery due to high demand. Unfortunately, his response lacked tact and carried an undertone of insolence. A similar encounter unfolded when my father sought clarification on the relative strength of the latte compared to the cortado. Jose responded with a sarcastic smile and uncalled-for rudeness, generating an atmosphere that made us feel somewhat guilty for not being well-versed in coffee intricacies. It is disheartening that the excellent potential of this cafe was overshadowed by the conduct of a single staff member. In order to cultivate a truly exceptional dining experience, it is crucial to ensure that every member of the team exhibits professionalism, respect, and a commitment to customer satisfaction (and most importantly, manners). We sincerely hope that steps will be taken to address this issue, as it would be a shame for future patrons to endure similar treatment.",

Now for the taste. So they taste good, but its nothing special. Above all, there is so much filling inside that you can hardly taste the croissant dough. Its a shame that the round croissant isnt available without filling. The cruffin with cinnamon and sugar is awesome.",

Is it worth hours in line (probably not) also I don t like waiting in line for that long. With that said, we did go at the 8am opening on a Tuesday and manage to score the croissants with just 3 people ahead of us. I sure am glad I got to try it. It is flaky, soft buttery and the pistachio cream is divine. Yes, I would buy these again if I m in NYC and I don t have to wait hours in line. The chocolate one is more dark chocolate cream than milk chocolate but it was still delicious. We also did ate breakfast and everything was refine. A bit pricey but for the ambiance, service and quality of the food, it is great value. We had a bit of a mishap with our order but our server Hector G smoothed it out and gave us such a great service. Is it a must oh yeah.",

Honestly, its not worth the price or the time to wait. The only thing that was worth it was the experience. They put on a lot of show for little, in Brazil Im sure well find much tastier and better quality croissants. We were the first in line, and the graduate that they say would leave at such a time is just a marketing strategy. Because the croissant we ate didnt come out at that time, it was cold and hard, it looked old, like it had been made the day before. I thought it was a lack of consideration for those who wait so long, they delivered that type of croissant. If I could turn back time, I wouldnt waste my precious time in New York, to eat him. Im not saying its bad, it was good. But nothing much. I wouldnt go back there, because I know I find things much more delicious than it. Nothing extraordinary. Rating 4 out of 10 (the pistachio cream was very good) Yet another proof that me being valued on tiktok doesnt mean its good",

Fizeram muito show para pouca coisa, no Brasil tenho certeza que encontramos croissant bem mais gostosos e com mais qualidade. Eramos os primeiros da fila, e a formada que eles dizem que sairia em tal horario e apenas uma estrategia de marketing. Pois o croissant que comemos nao saiu aquele horario, estava frio e duro, parecia velho, que tinha feito no dia anterior. Achei uma falta de consideracao com quem espera tanto tempo, entregaram aquele tipo de croissant. Se pudesse voltar o tempo, nao perderia meu precioso tempo em New York, para comer ele.

I decided to order an orange juice since the coffee was very strong and I doubted whether they had made it decaffeinated as I requested, I wasnt going to risk it. They forgot about the juice and brought it back when we were done, so I refused to accept it. The waitress approached me very rudely to tell me that there was only one barista and the truth is that that is not my problem at all. When we decided to pay, they did not have a contactless payment machine (strange) and they told me that they were going to delay the collection of my order. Having paid, which I did with USD 100, they should have given me 23.78 in change and they only gave me 23. The situation was already bothering me quite a bit. When I left the waitress asked me if I was going to leave a tip and obviously I said no. My question is the following: With what face, after such excellent service, do you ask me for a tip? The truth is that it was an unpleasant experience, very bad treatment and the non-existence of their  star  product. Its a place I never plan to go to and if you ask me, I would never recommend it.

                "review_translated_text": "Antes que nada fuimos a eso de las 9 de la manana y no habia lo unico por lo que la gente visita este lugar. Produccion pesima. Sentados para desayunar se nos dice que no se puede pedir nada de la panaderia. Absurdo. Cuando nos sirvieron el desayuno llego primero el omelet con las patatas y se olvidaron del cafe, tuve que pedirlo. Llegado el cafe el desayuno ya estaba frio. Decidi pedir un jugo de naranja ya que el cafe estaba muy fuerte y dude en si me lo habiab hecho descafeinado como pedi, no me iba arriesgar. Se olvidaron del jugo y lo trajeron cuando ya habiamos terminado, por lo que me negue a aceptarlo. La camarera se acerco de muy mala manera a decirme que habia solo un barista y la verdad es que ese no es para nada mi problema. Cuando decidimos pagar no tenian maquina para cobra con contactless payment (raro) y me dijo que iba a demorar la cobranza de mi pedido. Habiendo pagado, que lo hice con USD 100 me deberian haber dado de cambio 23,78 y me dieron solo 23. Ya me estaba molestando bastante la situacion. Cuando me retiro la camarera me pregunto si iba a dejar propina y obviamente le dije que no. Mi pregunta es la siguiente ?Con que cara, despues de un servicio de cuarta, me pide propina? La verdad que una experiencia desagradable, muy mal trato y la no existencia de su producto  estrella . Es un lugar al que no pienso ir nunca y si me preguntan, no lo recomendaria nunca. Y por ultimo, me parece muy caro para lo que ofrecen y lo unico lindo de esta experiencia, es el local que es hermoso. First of all we went at about 9 in the morning and there was no the only thing people visit this place for. lousy production. Sitting down for breakfast we are told that nothing can be ordered from the bakery. Absurd. When we were served breakfast the omelette with the potatoes came first and they forgot the coffee, I had to ask for it. When the coffee arrived, breakfast was already cold. I decided to ask for an orange juice since the coffee was very strong and I doubted if they had made it decaffeinated as I requested, I was not going to risk it. They forgot the juice and brought it after we were done, so I refused to accept it. The waitress approached me in a very rude way to tell me that there was only one barista and the truth is that that is not my problem at all. When we decided to pay, they did not have a machine to charge with contactless payment (rare) and she told me that she was going to delay the collection of my order. Having paid, which I did with USD 100, they should have given me 23.78 in change and they only gave me 23. The situation was already bothering me enough. When I left the waitress asked me if she was going to leave a tip and obviously I said no. My question is the following: with what face, after a fourth-rate service, does she ask me for a tip? The truth is that an unpleasant experience, very bad treatment and the non-existence of its star product. It is a place that I never plan to go to and if you ask me, I would never recommend it.

That is a sanitary issue if the place have bugs flying around. Eventually, the problem was resolved by the manger but that should not have happened! Additionally, given the level of poor service we give 10% tip and was haggled by the waiter to pay more tip. I felt disrespected and pressured to pay more for poor service. Now let s get to the food. Everything was below average I m sure most people could make better quality and much more flavorful dishes. We also ask to order the supreme croissant and they told us to go outside and queue up to order it while we were sitting at our table waiting for the food we order to come. So if you are sitting in your table you have walk outside and wait for possibly 2 hours for what I heard is actually an overrated pastry. Bathroom is very filthy so don t go unless you really need to or you may lose your appetite. This place is very overrated - go try it out for yourself or spend your time and money in other much better restaurants in NYC.",

The chocolate is more delicious (but it s not too much, it s not a delicious chocolate filling, it s just that the filling is less sweet and less greasy!

The couple in front of us were humiliated - she asked them if they really stood in line. It was such a racist experience. Somehow they think theyre entitled to be rude. Were literally paying for service, please recruit people who are trained to provide good service. Facing racial bias is such a let down.

Previous reviews I read said there tend to be lines and limits but when I went around 9am on a Friday there was no line and there were still plenty available at the counter. The choices were pistachio, chocolate, or banana cream. I got both the chocolate and the banana cream and both tasted super rich and delicious. The banana cream one was slightly better for me personally so I d definitely recommend that flavor. The counter line moved fast and I also picked up a coffee which is La Colombe beans so it hit the spot. Overall, this place is beautifully decorated and the ambiance and selection are top notch. Just be ready to pay almost $10 for a single supreme croissant!",

Made a reservation as a surprise for a friend to enjoy mimosas and pastries only to be told that if you sit in the restaurant, you cannot buy any of the pastries from the bakery aka the famous croissants that we came here for. The concept doesn t make sense to me at all and nowhere does it say that to get anything from the bakery, you have to stand in line and won t be able to dine in or vice versa. Disappointing as we ended up ordering the  pastry basket  on the restaurant menu only to be told that they gave two pastry options and no basket-  a regular almond croissant, not the bakery one and a scone. So we had our scone while looking at the pastries 10 feet away from us. Strange concept.",

I expected a higher level of service and better quality food especially given the price tag this place carries. We came for dinner and I must say I liked the vibe of the place very much - jazz music subtly playing, intimate French decor, dimmed lights, stunning bar - all on point! Plus the staff was very well dressed, something I enjoyed very much and wish to see more in a similar type of restaurant! However the rest of the evening, including the food, drinks and service was a let down. We ordered two French wines, but they were not good in taste - I understand that might be personal preference but all 6 of us agreed on that. Over the course of the night we had multiple waiters and they seemed out of sync - they kept forgetting to fill our wine glasses and it came to the point we had to proactively call one of them to refill the wine, they tried multiple times to take our plates away even though we were not finished. When it comes to food, the bread served with butter was good, but the crust of the bread was heavily burnt and tasted like charcoal. I only had a french onion soup which was not my favourite - very beefy with actual chunks of beef and very little onion. Normally I dont have a problem with any of the mishaps written above, but I would not expect them to happen in a restaurant where I paid nearly 100 USD for two glasses of wine and two soups! I still want to try the bakery, but I will not be visiting again nor recommending this restaurant to anyone! Atmosphere **** Service *** Food *** Paid by card. Visited in May 2023.",

Its a beautiful restaurant in a prime location, and the service is attentive and welcoming. I only stopped in for breakfast, so I cant comment on other offerings. I found the lemon ricotta pancakes just okay (one pancake tasted a little burnt) for the price ($25). The portion size was good for me, but if you have a big appetite, you may need to order sides. Plus cold brew and tax/tip, this breakfast ran me $40 not cheap. But I would come back if Im in the area and want to entertain a guest. You should definitely make a reservation to skip the line.",

                "review_text": "I finally got the opportunity to try the pistachio Supreme croissant at Lafayette Bakery (with no line!) when I walked in on a weekday. While it was good, I was underwhelmed, especially seeing that the line for these croissants snakes around the corner on weekends. The croissant itself was not too sweet, which was a plus for me, but it was a bit on the dry side. The pistachio cream was delicious in the top half of the croissant and lacking on the bottom half. While I wouldnt necessarily go out of my way to wait in line for this croissant, I was glad to have been able to check it off my list. At the steep price of $9.50, this is probably a once and done treat. I think the croissants at Librae (close by) are much more buttery, flakey, and flavorful for the price.",

Wine isnt that good, or you need to spend 200$ for a good bottle. Meat is good, there are no logical sides. I got a mint salad??? Who eats mint salad? 52$ for 2 little lamp chops and gross merguez (the worst we have ever tasted) Im sorry but is the French chef satisfied of his food? Id rather have just 2 lamb chops and 3 potatoes. Seriously. My 2 stars go to your manager and staff for their service and kindness. As everyone around me said, this is way too overpriced for no good reason. Id rather spend 600$ on a perfect meal that doesnt pretend to be the best French restaurant in Soho.... sorry!",

Also the iced latte my fiance got was not that nice. The employee was kind of unmotivated and not that friendly. My pain au chocolat was nice but quite pricey (~9,5$) and for me personally the chocolate filling was way too much. All in all 4/5 stars",

                "review_text": "I recently had the opportunity to dine at the Lafayette restaurant, and while the food was certainly enjoyable, I found myself thoroughly disappointed with the lack of service and care provided by the staff. The restaurant itself was packed to the brim, with a queue stretching out the door and around the corner, reminiscent of the crowds at Everest Basecamp. However, it seemed that the popularity of this spot was driven more by New Yorkers insatiable desire to be trendy and relevant rather than the quality of the dining experience. Unfortunately, this lack of service is becoming an all-too-common trend in New Yorks dining scene, with many popular spots neglecting the basics of hospitality. The tipping culture and lack of attention to detail are leading to the downfall of proper dining, which is a true shame for those who love the art of dining. Even though Lafayette offers a delectable croissant, it cannot excuse the lack of service provided. In fact, this cult following should be an embarrassment to the establishment itself. Its disappointing to see a restaurant prioritize its image over the satisfaction of its guests, as it ultimately leads to an unfulfilling experience. As someone who values a proper dining experience, I hope to see a shift in the New York dining scene towards an emphasis on service and hospitality. While good food is certainly important, it is the experience as a whole that truly sets a restaurant apart. If restaurants continue to neglect this aspect, they will inevitably lead to their own downfall.",

I went several times trying to buy those croissants and there were always a lot of people. 2 first times when my turn arrived there weren't anymore croissants... You have to go very early. But I had people visiting me last week so I decided to book a table so we could sit in their beautiful salle and take a peaceful delicious breakfast. FIRST BAD SURPRISE: all those things you see in the counter IS NOT AVAILABLE WHEN YOU'RE SIT. That doesn't make any sense!! People don't go to eat eggs bennedict that we can eat eveywhere in the city... So we ordered two things that they didn't wanted to keep the tables and go to the counter to buy the other things. But once we finished our dishes, with our coffees still not finished, THEY GAVE US THE TICKET RIGHT AWAY. The salle was almost empty and nobody was waiting to be sitted, there were no rush, no need to make us leave. We were on holidays, we had time for a peaceful breakfast... It's a pity that a beautiful site like this, with good waiters and very good food has this nonsenes that ruins the experience. I'm already telling to people to not to go. We already have those instagramy round filled croissants in other places...",

To top it all off, I truly do not appreciate staff commenting on how quickly or slowly I consume my food - twice during todays service I had a waiter proclaim that was quick!, which is just... unnecessary and insensitive.",

We went 2 days in a row because the first day we didn t know this info and missed it. When we went at the right time, we had to wait in line 45 mins. I would ve left but my friend really wanted to try it. We finally get to choose our croissant and the only options are filled with chocolate or icing  I thought there would be a plain one. I was very disappointed because I do not like this added filling. I got one anyways, and did not like it because it was 80% filling, 20% croissant. My friend loved it though, so I guess it just depends on your preference. Overall would not recommend waiting in line for this.",

There were no seats at the bar, so i went back to the host and begged again for a table since we had made a long trip to get there. There were several available so he gave us one. We were rushed to get our order in. My omelette arrived cracked at the edges, looked bare and unappealing served alongside a few lettuce leafs. For a place with a good reputation, i was shocked.  The staff hassled us FOUR TIMES to take away our plates while I was still eating, and one of the service people actually moved my feet out if the way to sweep.  It was extremely rude and i nearly burst into tears.",

Although the cronut appeared super delicious from the instagram images. The texture and taste do not match up to its appearance. I thought the filling would be much richer like buttercream or something of this nature, but its like whipped cream.

The shakshuka was bland, had no spices, and they burnt the 2 pieces of tiny toast they give you with it. I asked but unburnt toast, the waiter was kind to take it away, but brought back another 2 pieces of burnt toast. They knew it was my bday so randomly in the middle of our meal while we were eating this disgusting food, they brought out a huge dusty fake cake tower with a sparkling candle on top. It took up half the tiny table I sat in. Totally unnecessary and dumb. Just give me a croissant or something.",

Then we asked about the supremes and got told we had to get in line to get one - we re paying customers that ordered multiple dishes, coffee, juices and leave a decent tip and I gotta get in line for a pastry? Make it make sense guys. The food we ve received was average and no one checked in with us until we asked for the bill. If you come here, just get a pastry and leave (since their pastries are definitely the bomb!), don t bother eating here though - there are wayyy better places in NYC with way better service.",

                "review_text": "The beloved Lafayette, where everyone praises it for its excellent breakfasts, I noticed that there is always a queue to get in so I booked from Google: very simply when you have the location of the place there is the possibility of booking a table, a confirmation email will be sent to you, if you have a delay you can change the time or cancel the booking so excellent (Because when we arrived outside the place there was no one waiting to enter, the place inside wasnt full, on the contrary... but when we left after 40 minutes there was already a queue. I think for the bakery area but in short, its better to book than never go wrong) Inside on the right there is the bakery with a delicious display case with sweets and sandwiches, and the rest of the place is set up as a restaurant area. We ate in the restaurant area, they put us in a nice position, in the morning the sun lights up the whole place and it is very pleasant. The menu is small, I expected more choice, and the prices are not indifferent. Finally, we chose a cappuccino, pancakes and an egg sandwich which, given the price of the latter, arrived a little small for what we expected but very good. Excellent pancakes! Excellent and kind service, always attentive to everything. Next time I would like to try getting some desserts from the bakery, like the brioches which seem really excellent to me! I would happily go back, it was a beautiful morning. Thank you Lafayette",

Penso per la zona bakery pero insomma meglio che prenotiate che non sbagliare mai) All interno sulla destra c e la bakery con una deliziosa vetrina con dolci e panini, e il resto del locale e allestito come zone ristorante. Noi abbiamo mangiato nella zona ristorante appunto, ci hanno messo in una bella posizione, alla mattina il sole illumina tutto il locale ed e molto piacevole. Il menu e piccolo, mi aspettavo piu scelta, e i prezzi non sono indifferenti. Abbiamo scelto infine un cappuccino, i pancakes e un egg sandwich che appunto per il prezzo che ha quest ultimo e arrivato un po   piccolo per come ce lo aspettavamo ma molto buono. Pancake ottimi! Servizio ottimo e gentile, sempre attenti a tutto. Prossima volta vorrei provare a prendere qualche dolce dalla bakery , tipo le brioche che mi sembrano veramente ottime! Ci tornerei volentieri, e stata una bella mattinata. Grazie Lafayette",

Both the flavors were nice and the croissant was flaky and creamy. On its own the croissants are nice but dont really live up to the hype on social media. The salted cookie though is heavenly.",

The major issue is that the filling is only in one half of the croissant, so you barely taste it and only get hit with sugar. For these reasons, I would have to say that the wait isnt worth it, and theres no indoor seating available either. On top of that, the staff isnt particularly patient.

We came on a Tuesday at 11:35a and we were about 6th in line. The line got long around 11:45a starting to wrap around the building. We got the blood orange and pistachio. The filling is smooth and pudding-like. The blood orange flavor is spot on but the pistachio one is a tad bit too sweet for me. I wish there were some pieces of pistachio inside the cream itself. The croissant texture is pretty standard. Overall its done well but not something super special IMO. The rest of the restaurant is a nice french bistro. The bread in the bakery also looked amazing. We may come back for the bistro or other pastries but wont be for the spiral croissant. The staff is also very nice. They have a restroom you can use as part of the restaurant for the travellers who need to worry about finding restrooms.",

There is a drop of 120 supreme croissants at 8am-12-4pm. One per customer only - so if you want to try them all, I suggest going with friends. We went on a weekday at opening about 30 mins before opening and were 5 in line. Later times and weekends seem to be longer lines. The monthly special was basically sold out by the time we left. Taste wise, I would rate it a 7/10. Not the best croissant nor the best filling but the novelty is there if you want to try it. I would recommend getting the monthly special and the pistachio.",

I prefer the chocolate on the top, rather than the filling choco inside. Its a little bit too sweet for me, I can only finish half. Pistachio Croissant  ranks higher than Choco flavor ( personally). But again, the filling could be better comparing to the top. If they have original flavored wheel croissant, I would give it 5 star.",

I thought the food was excellent and was so happy that one did not have to go to Paris to eat exquisite quiche, omelette and  pastries etc. I immediately came back this Valentines weekend with the other two Hazelnuts and recruited 4 more friends to have brunch at Lafayette. We ordered the quiche, omelette, salmon benedict, croque madame, and the boulangerie basket. I also ordered extra pastries from the bakery to share at the table. Let me begin by saying the supreme croissant was very good. We were able to acquire 2, one which we ate immediately, the other we ate 4 hours later. It held up well. In fact, I thought it tasted better eaten later when the filling was not as oooey gooey. The frittes that came with the croque madame was also very good. The boulangerie basket was as good as I remembered, it was gone in an instant. My husband ordered the quiche which I had raved about all December long. It was just mehhh this time. We  ve had much better quiche at our local French Cafe in Venice, Florida ( Croissant and Co ). My son s omelette I could have recreated at home. So I guess consistency is not there. I was just let down because I brought my husband and son for this food trip and gathered our friends and raved about this place and it was just mehhh. One thing they were consistent about though ( from my December trip experience and this time around in February ), the coffees always came much later than the food so the enjoyment of sipping coffee while eating the food and specially the pastries was lost.",

Went for breakfast and to try their famous supreme croissant. HEADS UP, the bakery is separated from the dine in area, you cant order a bakery while you are having a meal inside. So I bought my croissant in advance and took it to the dine section to have my morning breakfast. Friendly staff, service was good, there was a mistake in my order which they promptly corrected it. I had the pistachio croissant, super rich and heavy....I ate only half. Breakfast was ok overall, nothing special except its fresh. I was there at 8 am Sharp, and there was no line, and it remained like this till I left at 9 am. So if you want to avoid the long waiting, you can come early on a weekday.",

The reality is this line put patrons at risk to leave because of how poorly the curve customers.  Be advised the wait line is long.",

                "review_text": "A few months ago, in Barcelona, everybody started talking about a local bakery that sells the new trending pastry in NYC: a round croissant filled with pistachio. I have never had the opportunity to try it out and, to be honest, that does not sound too appealing to me: in my opinion, a croissant must be shaped like a   and, most of all, it must be plain! (or it s a cornetto ) But again, when we arrived in NYC, we didnt know anything about the city anymore, so we checked on the Internet. I looked for salty food and my wife looked for sweets (well, I did look for ice creams and doughnuts myself, to be fair) and she found Lafayette, the original  inventor  of this round pastry (they call it Supreme, btw, but it s  a croissant). First, we had to queue (under the rain!) for about 20 minutes to get inside just to order to go... While we were queuing, we could see through the Windows all the content creators inside showing a camera how much they were enjoying their Supreme: sad. Once inside, I was amazed by... the darkness of the venue. I couldnt even see what I was ordering. Honestly, I knew what I was coming for, otherwise, I couldnt have known what to order... they dont want us to see what we eat? Thats a shame because, when I got used to the darkness, I could guess that the venue actually looked very nice. I sincerely dont know why they dont turn the light on. So the clerk at the counter told us about the 4 flavors available that day and we picked pistachio and the seasonal: Supreme de Noel. I must say that the pistachio Supreme was very good, at least the half where there was cream. The other half was just like a regular croissant, a good one but nothing from another world either. The Supreme de Noel was not that good, the cream was too thick, I guess to make it seem like an actual buche but that didnt fit the Supreme so much. Dont get me wrong, it was not bad, but for $10 a piece and a 20-minute rainy line, I expected way more. I would trade this for a good croissant or a pistachio cornetto anytime.

We came upfront and were told that we have to wait in line which was at that time roughly 40 ppl in the coldest day( it was 11 F), I wouldnt mind but my wife is pregnant, after calling manager( very rude person) he said that is nothing he can do pregnant or not they count people and bakery and its only 1 per customer and advised me to go and wait online with pregnant wife in freezing weather or come back at 4p.m when they have new batch. I will make sure this will get posted everywhere, the worst customer service ever.",

The chocolate croissant s filling (which tasted like school lunch pudding), was entirely concentrated in 1/4 of the croissant, the rest was dough. Maybe that s good because the dough was the best part but it was underwhelming. The frosting on the coconut yuzu croissant was sickeningly sweet and the filling sprayed out with any pressure. Both croissants were far too indulgent for us to finish. Finally, the Farm egg sandwich (which took an extra 15 minutes to get) was clearly well made but the bun was flavorless and the egg patty was needlessly an inch thick. Lafayette hides gluttony under the guise of aesthetics and I m deeply disappointed.",

The salmon eggs Benedict has their own biscuit  read under it. It is corn based, light and fluffy. It has turn what is usually a gut bomb into a light and refreshing brunch.

                "review_text": "Lafayette cafe & bakery is an excellent example of how visibly long lines do not necessarily equate to food that makes the wait worth it. I initially heard about Lafayette through various food blogs that were raving about their delicious take on French cuisine and baked pastries. Upon my arrival to Lafayette, I was stunned and a bit intimidated by the supremely long ling wrapping around the corner block to get into the restaurant and bakery. Once my party and I were seated at a snug booth table, we ordered their boulangerie basket of pastries, brunch brisket burger, lemon ricotta pancakes topped with berries, a croque madam, and a round of cold brew. Additionally, we lined up to get their highly rated pastries from the bakery (of which their signature pastry, The Supreme, a kouign aman-esque take on the famed French croissants) was not available for restaurant guests to feast on. For good reason, the resto-cafe had a long history of guests making reservations at the busy cafe, only to order The Supreme, and nothing else. Now, onto the food review, the cold brew was bland and frankly, quite bitter. The tray of assorted pastries were unremarkable and were not worth the $25 listed price. The brunch brisket beef burger was tender, juicy, and surprisingly well seasoned, the accompanying fries were fantastic. The croque madame was simply bland and its only redeeming quality was a generous serving of ham for its filling. The lemon ricotta pancakes were equally mediocre asides from the copious helping of assorted berries. Finally, with regards to the pastries from the bakery, myself and my party felt that many of the items were too doughy, overbaked, and simply not worth the wait. However, the service and staff was on-par with a restaurant of this quality, the waiters were attentive and helpful. Plus points for the beautiful decor and exceptional waitstaff team. If I were to sum up my experience at the Lafayette, I would simply say that it is overhyped standard French cuisine fare. My final rating is 2.5/5 stars.",

                "review_text": "My wife and I went to Lafayette right after Thanksgiving week. As a pastry chef myself, I was looking forward to try their famous spiral croissant. We did have to wait in line for 45 minutes. Once we got to the counter, the gentleman was very attentive, polite and knowledgable of the items. We ended up getting a raspberry danish, the maple bourbon spiral croissant and sat down for breakfast. The breakfast omelette was fairly average - nothing too exciting.  The bread that came with it was delicious and like a typical French breakfast, the bread was accompanied by yummy jam. The raspberry danish was very good, the danish was flaky and you could tell they used real butter and the flavor of the raspberry filling was just enough not to make it overwhelming. The spiral croissant honestly was a let down. The lamination was not that great, I am wondering if they used real butter for it, and the cream in my opinion was way too much and did not have the best of flavors. Overall the service was good, the ambiance is very nice, Parisian style but honestly would not go again. NYC has way better places for croissants.",

The staff were very friendly and pleasant to deal with and dressed to suit the decor. When we got here at around 1:30pm there was a small queue however, we werent able to get the infamous Chocolate croissant as they were sold out. However, the staff announced that they would have some more around 4pm. So plan to be here early or else come later in the day if your mission is to sample the croissants! In lieu of the croissant we got an apple danish and some coffees. The pastry was very light and flaky with loads of layers! The apple filling was perfect and so delicious! We sat in an area that is reserved for bakery customers if they want to sit down and enjoy their pastries. Then there is another larger area for anyone looking for the restaurant section. I will have to stop by the next time that I am in New York and in the NoHo area and hopefully get a chance to try their famous Chocolate croissants!",

Delicious peeling like few others and the amaretto not at all stomach-churning. Everything changed on the second day. For some strange reason, the rules of the place do not allow breakfast to be served if you do not strictly take what is written on the menu, so we were rudely kicked out from the mezzanine floor and had to re-order. We were drawn here by the photos of the different flavored cinnamon rolls, as they looked very intriguing, but that was the beginning of the end. The very good pastry was irremediably ruined by the various toppings: a mousse that didnt taste like chocolate, a pistachio cream that had nothing pistachio-like and finally a coconut cream that actually tasted like lemon. To crown this second terrible experience, a latte macchiato (finally understood as a term) which however only tasted burnt. We left with a chemical taste in our mouths and a stomach ache.

Una sfogliatura deliziosa come poche e lamaretto per niente stomachevole. Tutto e cambiato il secondo giorno. Per qualche strano motivo, il regolamento del locale non consente la colazione servita se non prendi rigorosamente quanto scritto sul menu, quindi siamo stati cacciati in malo modo dal piano rialzato e abbiamo dovuto rifare lordinazione. Siamo stati attirati qui dalle foto dei cinnamon roll dai diversi gusti, dato che sembravano molto intriganti, ma e stato linizio della fine. La sfoglia molto buona e stata irrimediabilmente rovinata dai vari condimenti: una mousse che non sapeva di cioccolato, una crema al pistacchio che di pistacchio non aveva niente e infine una crema al cocco che in realta sapeva di limone. Per coronare questa seconda pessima esperienza, un latte macchiato (finalmente compreso come termine) che pero sapeva solo di bruciato. Siamo usciti col sapore di chimico in bocca e il mal di pancia.

Yuzu Coconut Mojito Croissant $9.5/each is the new flavor I believe, or it could be a limited edition. I love it so much since it taste sweet and sour, and it s very fresh, not just a single sweet. But I couldn t taste any coconut. Anyway, those croissants are all amazing! I have queued and wait for 50 mins to buy it, I can say it s still worthy. There are 3rd flavor, which is the Chocolate Croissant, but  only one Croissant per person allow to purchase. The second important thing is  the signature croissant is start being sold at 8am, 12pm, 4pm everyday And you have to come at least 30 mins in advance . I have also purchased a Carrot Cake $5.5/each. It taste good too. I thought it would be very sweet but actually not. The cream on the top is not really sweet though. The staffs are nice and polite. The indoor dining environment and vibe is nice and beautiful. I guess having a brunch here is also a very chill event. Overall, I have a good experience here. I ll still recommend my friends to come.",

Its only one of their croissants per person, and you cannot order them if you dine in. I recommend coming for their morning 8am drop to avoid waiting in line for hours. We got the chocolate and pistachio croissants. Both were delicious, but personally dont think its worth standing in line for. Maybe good to experience and check out once but it was enough for me. Definitely more for the aesthetic. Just a warning, these croissants use pork gelatin, so it is not halal.",

They give a generous portion of mussels with thin, crispy fries. My favorite was the beef tartare with a quail egg on top. It was very flavorful. Ok I lie. My favorite was the desserts. We tried everything on the dessert menu and everyone in has their favorites. Mine was the chocolate layers cake. It is light, moist, and not overly sweet.

My sister and I were in the line with our doggies and of course we couldn t take doggies inside and when I told the guy my sister is outside and I wanna get one for her, he asked the person in front of me to confirm if I m saying the truth!!!

I went to get at least 6 of them for my family so wed all try it. Its not like they let you order in advance then pick it up, I checked their website and also whats missing on their website, an alert or something letting folks know you can only get one supreme per customer. All red flags because I think if they had a warning on their site, folks wouldnt waste a trip like I did. Just think, gas and tolls, just to get 1 measly pastry for $9.50 LOL they are bugging and will never catch me at their place of business ever again. I couldve spent $50 today but instead they only got $9.50 out of me and a customer who is not returning lol. Their loss and the kicker to all of this is, the supreme pastry wasnt all that special where Id say this day at least gave me one good thing. The pastry you can get anywhere, doesnt make this place worth visiting or waiting outside on a line just to get in. Now, I wouldnt have a problem if for large orders, they let you order in advance and pick it up so those waiting outside can at least get a pastry, thats fine but this place lacks options as their site shows and Im good never to visit again.

They were to open at 8am, but they did not let ppl start going in until about 5-8 minutes later. Once inside everything is very cute. Of course the croissant decor is a standout. The bakery is very small and gets crowded quicky. They only had one person helping with orders. It did not seem very efficient and he was kind of slow especially given the dozens of people waiting in line outside. I would definitely not wait in the 1-2 hour line that Ive heard about. We ordered a latte as well. Nothing special about the latte or the croissant. They were both ok but would not go back. Definitely glad we did not make a long line for this. Cool tourist stop for the croissant pic if you are lucky and short wait, if not I would skip.",

                "review_text": "What a joke. Here are the issues: 1. They dont let you order the croissants even if you have a reservation for brunch. 2. They only allow each customer to order maximum one croissant. Its obvious that they dont care how far the customers traveled here, how long the customers waited on the line outside, and how customers feel. 3. We waited outside for an hour, then we were told that the croissants were sold out when it was almost our turn. This is so unprofessional. 4. Their brunch tastes ok, but the portion is pretty small, plus its quite expensive. The service is ok. Overall, an overrated place. In my opinion: Whoever made the croissant rules needs to see a doctor. The establishment should allow leastly 2 croissants to be ordered for each customer, considering the long waiting time and the potential risk of a customer who has never tried their croissants and ordered a wrong one by mistake. Would you spend your money earned from your hard work at an establishment like this?",

The breakfast was surprisingly good and the assortment of pastries brought to the table was superb. Everything was good including the environment. It felt like a good little part of Paris but in reality, it was New York. What was disappointing was the chocolate croissant. After my breakfast, I was told that I had to wait an hour for the croissant in line in the hot sun. I was prepared for this and stayed in the long line. After about an hour I got the croissant but only one of them because there was a one limit per person. After getting the croissant it was not worth the hype. The croissant tasted like a normal croissant and wasnt anything out of this world. Although they were pretty I would recommend their other pastries because they were better. Overall 8/10",

Another great thing I ve heard was their service, but I was absolutely blown away when their service turned out to be equally as great (and maybe even better) than all the goodies they had to offer - all thanks to our wonderful server Gary V. Not only was Gary bubbly, kind, and friendly, he was also very knowledgeable about the menu s offerings and the secret to being about to snag up the famous croissants that they sell out of daily. Gary made this one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in the many years that I ve been frequenting New York and I cannot wait to see him again when I make the official move here next month. If you go to Lafayette, make sure you ask for Gary  V. I promise you won t regret it.",

We did not have a reservation for a table but were quickly seated at one of the bar tops, which offered a nice overview of the restaurant interior. The staff was very friendly, prompt, and proficient. We sampled a smoked Samon dish and a raspberry Danish along with a cafe latte. All 3 items were delicious and a nice way to start the day before walking around. The bakery portion of the store was already out of the many famous croissants, so sadly, we did not get the opportunity to try any of these this morning. Next time! I would suggest getting a reservation if you are more than a party of 2 or would like a table regardless of your party size.  Also come early if you want access to a full selection of items from the bakery and keep in mind the bakery and restaurant, while both inside, service customers separate from eachother and require standing in two separate lines. Enjoy!",

Their desserts menu is horrible, McDonald s has better dessert menu. They don t let you even try what we came for: the croissant; they said we had to go out on the street and wait in line for two hours to get a croissant, really, after we paid a fortune for mediocre food.

When we got there and sat at our table, our waiter informed us that if we want one of their famous croissants we cannot order them from the restaurant, we have to wait in a line outside. So stupid! If were spending a hundred dollars at your restaurant, the least you can do is let us order a croissant for our dessert, not tell us to go wait in a queue outside after we eat! Fine, moving on. When we were sat, two tables next to us were sat after. One about 5 minutes, the other after 20. Both of these tables got their order before us. One even finished eating. We ordered an overpriced burger and croque madame! It took us a ridiculously long time to get our food. We didnt even complain, but it was bewildering. At this point, I was starving and just hoping the food would be good. But it wasnt. Worst croque madame I have ever had! Even the fries were extremely salty and I couldnt finish half of them. The only thing positive I can say is apparently the burger was good, but Im not the one who ordered it. Also, the restaurant itself is cozy and our waiter and the wait staff were nice as well, despite how long it took to receive our food. Funny enough, our waiter told us he wouldnt wait in the line around the block for one of their croissants, so that made me feel less bad about not getting one. I will not be going back to this place until the hype dies down, and even then it will just be to try one of their croissants.",

While dining in for brunch i went into the bakery to get the circle croissant. then come to find out they were sold out and you actually have to wait outside AGAIN in the bakery line. The manager said he was outside and got a head count of everyone who is wanting a circle croissant and they only have a select number.

They are not interested in checking what table is near finishing their dinner/ have their check dropped, they suggest that you should walk around and check. Overall not a place worth waiting over 30 minutes for a table with reservation. Just go across the street to ACME it looks much better and the service is amazing.",

Since they dont have portable heaters available, its better to bundle up. Overall though, the morning atmosphere is pleasant. busy streets with constant discussion.

Server was also not very pleasant especially after she found out we wanted to share a meal (the portion sizes are huge).

I waited 25 minutes in line (at 8:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning) to get the famous croissant roll or bourbon maple nut supreme and it was worth the cost!! The foliage is delicious and buttery!!! I admit that I still preferred its chocolate counterpart! But I recommend! The only downside: the price! It costs $8.50 (excl. VAT) for the bourbon and $9.50 for the chocolate, which is relatively high for a chocolate croissant as good as it can be! Same for the $6 hot chocolate and dust! In summary, its quite expensive but the quality is there. So to have a little pleasure from time to time, its perfect!",

We got there early per employee because we missed out on our first attempt.  Stood inline for 30 mins, which isn t that bad.  Get to the counter to order and find out we re only allowed to order one per person.  Ok I get it you want everyone to have an opportunity to try it.   I asked for one more because my wife didn t want to go that early.  Manager was not obliging, I didn t ask for 10 more I asked for one more.  Even the guy checking me looked confused because it was just one more . Manager told me I could stand in-line again if I wanted one more!!!! So, finally try it and it wasn t filled all the way with cream like all the videos , we had little bit of cream right at the very top. Super duper let down!!!! We had a pistachio which my sister ordered, chocolate and a bourbon maple all cream filled let down!  Ok I m giving it 3 stars because amaretto croissant and olive pesto Galette were by far the best things I had from Lafayette.  Which we got 2 days in row, because it was so good!!  So try other things when you go.  To sum up the manger sucks and the cream filled croissants need more cream!!!!",

Came with 2 friends and it s supposed to be 1 croissant per person to make sure everyone in line is able to purchase one. Since we were 3 we got to try all 3 flavors available at that time: bourbon maple, pistachio, chocolate. Chocolate is my personal favorite but the maple is a very very close 2nd. Borderline tie. They let you in in groups of 5-6 people. There are some tables inside which you can sit at after purchase if you d like to eat your croissant right away with some coffee (also bought at the payment counter).",

However we as customers need to raise our standards. If any restaurant made us wait 1.5 hours and restricted our choices/quantity, itll be burned to the ground with 1 star reviews. So why should Lafayette be allowed the luxury of hiding poor customer service & management. After all, 5 star reviews means you should be excellent all around. Unfortunately, their lack of planning & management to estimate how much sales are expected is appalling. Standing in line for 1.5 hours to get max. 1 quantity of an item (supreme croissant) is outrageous. You know how many customers check out daily, you know the demand and yet you disrespect peoples time and make them stand in line for 90 minutes. And even after that you have the audacity to tell us that we can only buy 1 per customer. You may think this gives you moral high ground because you serve as many as you can, but its just poor management as a bakery owner.",

I asked if we can get something to go and she said again were closed. The party was downstairs  the whole upstairs was empty so I dont get why we couldnt order something to go. Also there were empty tables outside. I guess they got it like that and they dont need the money. As I turned to leave a line formed behind me with many shock looks of dismay and disbelief. Also they could of posted on social media to let ppl know. Do better Lafayette or you could be closed as fast as many other restaurants have!!!",

I love croissants. But this spin on the traditional form is not my new go to by any means. The exterior is flaky but also too crispy. The center is fluffy but the filling is underwhelming. I tried the Pain au chocolat Supreme. There was a chocolate topping on the outside and almost a chocolate pudding or mousse like filling inside. The outside chocolate was better, it was more like a ganache. I went so far as to hear it up to bring it back to its prime state of production. Nothing helped. I do not see what the fuss is about. The cinna-cruffin was okay but I will not be buying any more. It s is essentially a croissant posing as a muffin. I must have missed the muffin part. Only the shape and form lend itself to that characteristic. It barely did justice as a croissant. I ll stick to the bakery classics from now on lol. But enjoy!",

The staff we initially spoke to were friendly however the gentleman who took our order and seemed to be a section manager was unbelievably rude. When we placed our order of an almond and plain croissant (from the menu we were handed) along with a couple of drinks we were asked  Is that it?  and then told we shouldn t be sitting inside with such a small order ($26 total) but he d make an exception as we were already seated. Before we had finished eating the same guy (40s with greasy hair) walked by and threw the bill down on our table without saying a word. I can understand if there s a policy however this should be clearly explained by the front of house or at least noted on the menu. At this point the restaurant was only around 60% full so it seems unreasonable. The food itself was above average (3.5 / 5.0 and levels below Dominique Ansel ) however the overall experience was very much soured by the rude and unprofessional behaviour from the waiter.",

Operations was clunky and incredibly slow. We stood in line for almost an hour just to buy pastry to go. Once inside, although it was fast to order, the cashier was also very slow and weren t able to provide a printed or text receipt. They told us the banh mi would take 15-20 minutes, that s the longest wait ever for a sandwich with all cold ingredients. There was no number or receipt, nor space to wait within the bakery. No one called our name loud enough for us to hear when food was ready. The crunch supremes were indeed crunchy but too sweet for my taste. They were also quite big but clearly meant to be eaten in one sitting. I would be happier with a smaller size. More of a hyped novelty. The banh mi was incredibly disappointing with the wrong type of bread. Not at all crunchy, and a bit dense. The cucumbers were pickled which turned our disgusting. Do not recommend. This bakery has some potential but a complete operational overhaul is in order. Not sure if there is a manager but everyone felt a little lost some how.",

Food is beyond mediocre at high end prices,  so there is no value for your money. You also cannot get the filled croissant if you sit down for brunch or breakfast. The bakery First,  the place had a few flies when we went there.   The croissant sandwiches that were in the open were fair game for the flies,  see pictures. We got the filled croissant out was OK,  but not worth the 40 minute wait by any extent. I would say if this is why you are coming here,  skip this place and go to Dominique ansell for the original. We also tried a smore tart, it was good.",

And the food portions were very small for their price.  Afterwards we went to their bakery for their special croissants,  and the girl at the bakery told us in a very condescending manner to make the line outside all over again.  The longest line for their overrated croissants. We decided it wasn t worth it. We had already paid so much for their overrated  food now to make the line again was just not worth it.

When I arrived, there was a little line for the bakery and they told us immediately that the famous croissant was sold out. I was pretty bummed but still sat down to have brunch with my boyfriend. We were seated pretty fast and the food was actually pretty good. However, it took absolutely forever for the food to arrive and I was getting ready frustrated.",

First time I went, I was in the queue for 20 mins and they were out of it! This time I went 15 mins before they drop. It was raining and yet there was a queue outside waiting to try these. Like everyone I stood in the queue outside in rain hoping it s worth all these efforts. And it was worth it! I bought the Chocolate Croissant! Decadent and Scrumptious. Must try if you re in NYC. It was flaky, rich and with creamy filling. It might not look like it, but it s quite heavy (in terms of weight as well) Tips: These drop at 8am, 12 pm and 4pm daily. Reach 15-20 mins before the time to ensure you get it. Limited to only one per person. Chocolate was the only one that was eggless and it can change as the flavors change. They can be reached through text message for any questions.",

Last time I saw him yelling at guests. But for the first time I saw a women manager with a long braid and she was nice enough to let some customers wait inside. She was so nice!

Expect a line down the block if youre just going for bakery pastries, but if youre sitting down to eat get a reservation in advance. Dinner - had a great experience here! All courses were delicious, highlight was the banana ice cream with chocolate sauce dessert. Highly recommend the salmon appetizer, goat cheese ravioli with snow peas, and the trout entree! Fantastic. Loud and buzzy atmosphere at night.",

The pastries were good (famous croissants were already sold out at 8:45am), but when we ordered other pastries they did not bring us individual plates to eat them on and had to ask for plates to share our pastries. Some items in our order were forgotten and the salad served with the egg dishes was borderline rotten - very limp and browned. One part of someone s meal was brought out 20 minutes before the other half and the rest of our entrees. Service felt disjointed. Like I said, pastries were good, but not worth the trip across town.",

People come for the Supreme Croissant seen on IG ($9, limit 1 per person, put out 8am and 12pm daily), but its more marketing than taste. Looks beautiful, rotating flavors, thick filling, but cold and stiff. Crunchy and flaky if thats what you want. I prefer a croissant to be so buttery and warm and fresh that the flakes and pastry melt in your mouth. These are fun to try but not worth the wait or cost. The restaurant is also lackluster. Not many entree options for brunch and the burger, pancakes, croque monsieur, and omelette were all barely okay.",

But, after my last time coming with a group for a prefix brunch I will never be coming back. This restaurant is rude and has a complete lack of communication and customer service. I reserved a table for 14 on their online booking app. 14 was the max I could get, however our party was for 15 so I requested 15 in the notes. But I never heard back confirming they could do 15. All communication from them said 14 so I assumed they couldn t do it and our group size changed accordingly. They even confirmed 14 via text the day before and I did as well when I confirmed our reservation. During the brunch the food took forever. One of the couples in our group had to leave after two hours to make a flight and the entrees hadn t even come yet. You d think for a family style prefix the food would come regularly. The coffees didn t come until halfway through the meal. Then the bill came and we had all been there so long we were rushed to leave and we just signed and left. After reviewing the check later, they had charged us for 15 people after all that. $75 pp and we had only 14. Since they don t have a phone # to actually speak with someone, I emailed and asked for a refund. After a week of going back and forth they finally refunded me the $75 but didn t refund me the tax and tip for the extra person. This is absurd. I shouldn t have to fight for a refund for an extra plate when we never had a group of 15. Any restaurant with good service would have called me to discuss this like I requested several times and they would have rectified the situation immediately. Lafayette never even apologized and blamed me for the whole thing saying  for the future, we require 24 hours notice for any changes in party size to Chefs Menu.  For the future, I won t be coming back and neither will my friends and family.",

Also, they don t have an option to keep any of the bakery items warm or warm it up for you. You ve got to eat it cold if you get there when it s no longer fresh. We arrived around 5pm so i guess the pastries had just been sitting out all day. The coffee was okay. Customer service at the bakery was great, everywhere else in the restaurant not so much. I got the salted chocolate chip cookie (10/10), the chocolate croissant (7/10), and cafe au lait(6/10).",

If you just want to try the chocolate croissant, go straight to the bakery since they dont have it in their cafe menu. However, if youre planning to dine in and wants to try the croissant, they allow you to purchase it in the bakery and eat it with the rest of your foods. Overall the chocolate croissant was okay. The chocolate filling was generous and not too sweet. Its worth a try and definitely different than other croissants Ive tried. However, I probably wouldnt line up early in the morning unless Im craving it. The one that I found suprisingly good was the Pesto Nicoise Galette. Its savory but the pesto is not overwhelming. The olive on it was also good. If Im in the area and craving french pastries, I would probably go for the galette again.",

The challenge is like many of the NY restaurants which are crowded due to location, reservations are strong, and some parts work.  The reception was good.  The bar was good and attentive.  The table service was bad.  And not due to being busy.  The brunch crowd was leaving.  The waiter walked by a dozen times just doing a bit of this and that, and chatting with his coworkers.  Never stopped to check on anything.  So, if you re a city New Yorker and go out a frequently over the years, you ll understand.  You get used to good food and good service some places.  So when you see five star reviews and an occasional one like this, you go  I get it.  Occasional diners and twenty something s writing it up like it s great.  But it had no one managing the floor to really make it great .  And you ll pass.  So why write this review?  I hopes that maybe, maybe an owner or manager who gets it will go  we better work on this so we keep a good business for years, and not just until people find the next place to go and quit coming to us .",

The line for the croissants gets extremely long & people line up 1 1/2 hours before the purchasing time. 730am & 12pm & only 1 per customer.  This is madness!! This restaurant knows the popularity & really should consider allowing pre-orders to satisfy your existing & future customers. Ive witnessed numerous customers leaving because the line was so long  . Sales just leaving because of poor availability of a popular item.  Think about it Lafayette",

The second time I got the beloved  croissant . I stood in line at 12pm and it was already around the corner. The whole process to get a croissant took about 45 minutes and honestly, it s a fun  thing to do , very New York, but I probably would not do it again. The croissant is good. I got the chocolate one. The breading is so buttery, but it was not experiential to eat this croissant. And the stuffing piece is kind of like a pudding chocolate. It s probably fun to bring friends visiting, but as someone who lives here, I would just get the regular baked goods, not the special croissant.",

The reason for 1 star off: They should make it clear on their website that making reservations at the restaurant WONT get you to the front of the line at the bakery, nor allow you to order any bakery items. When we were seated at 11:15AM, it was only then that we found this out. So I waited inside and ordered the lunch food while my girlfriend and daughter waited in line. By the time they sat down, it was 12:20PM. While I was sitting and waiting, other customers also went through this same scenario as us. I actually had to get some of the food re-heated because it was cold by the time they sat down. Interestingly, the French Onion soup  was just the right temperature  because it was actually scorching hot when it was first brought out. As per their worker: Their famous Pain au Chocolat Supreme (chocolate filled Croissants) are brought out at 8AM and Noon. People start lining up at least an hour before. Just because youre standing in line, there is no guarantee youll be able to get any; despite the fact that only 1 per customer is allowed.",

We visited on a Sunday morning at about 10am, they were already sold out and the staff told us to wait for another batch at 12pm. It got crowded and lined up by entrance around 11:45am. We got one of each Rose Berry Spritz and Pain Au Chocolat which were the only two flavors available on that day. The portion was great enough to share and it s satisfying to see the filling flood out when tearing it. However, both the texture of pastry and the taste of filling were kind of cheap compared to its price. We felt disappointed and won t recommend to give it a try.",

The croque monsieur was toasted on one side but not the other, whatever they used to heat it up caused it to become soggy. It didn t taste like it had been made with French jambon or high quality French cheese. The salmon spinach quiche was way too salty ( very little salmon, very soggy overcooked spinach inside) and the tart shell was under baked (the eggs were the perfect consistency of a delicate egg custard but the entire quiche was very soggy from the heating process. The vanilla flan had a nice custard texture but didn t have that eggy flavor that it should have nor did it taste like high quality organic heavy cream was used, the vanilla wasn t coming through either ( the crust was also under baked. For these 3 items and two coffees we paid $30 which I would have rather spent on a nice dinner somewhere else. The espresso here was very good however we were given full caf when we ordered decaf. The woman at the counter was very rude and unhelpful. Most customers seemed afraid of her and just silently waited until they could quickly get their order and leave. Would not come here again. Everything looks way better than it tastes which is sadly way to often the case with French bakeries and patisseries in California, especially in tourist areas.",

The balance between the mild acidity of the fruit and the softness of the cream   a perfect combination. I prefer it more than the chocolate one, that one made me sick a little. Warning: There is a line outside to buy the cakes, at least around 12pm. And its also a bit absurd that you cant order cakes from the table, we had to get up and go to the cashier to do so.

My roommate is an early bird and I got lucky because she offered to go pick some up for us. It was a good crossaint but not worth the hype, I wouldn t wait in line or wake up early for it. If you are in the area, and happen to pass by and they are still there definitely check it out. It was good.

We had to go one by one to the counter and buy it there at the cashier (3 people for 3 croissants, 3 meters away from our table inside the bakery).  We got them in boxes because the cashier said he doesn t have plates for us even though we were already having breakfast inside at a table. Our waiter than told us that it s not really allowed to order the croissants for a seated breakfast . He finally gave us the tiniest plates ever and we ordered more stuff ( what we wanted to do in the first place) All the other food ended up being not good at all! Brown ham, squishy egg elc. The service was bad and not respectful or understanding at all. I am on vacation with my family from Europe so how were we supposed to know that the overpriced croissant isn t available for seated breakfast. Also first time he gave us the croissants in the boxes he gave us the wrong ones, we noticed that at our table. So we had to go back to the counter and get the right ones. The whole experience was ridiculous. Would not recommend, will never come again.",

Literally every Tiktok Id seen up to this point was saying that you had to be in line at 8am to get one of these croissants, so I wasnt expecting much, but I was surprised. Showed up at 12nn and they had a bunch of chocolate croissants and peach flavored ones. Would definitely give the cashier/barista 5 stars, I wanted lemonade and was told there wasnt any left, but he managed to whip up something for me and was very nice about it. Place was clean, staff was friendly. However, is the single croissant oozing with chocolate worth $8.50? In my opinion, no. It was good, dont get me wrong. Just not $8.50 good Would still definitely come back to try their breakfast/brunch options!",

It s also a very small coffee, so 3 sips and you re done. The pancakes are extremely delicious - no need for even syrup. Definitely much better than the omelette. The fries were good - they came out after we finished the meal so they didn t charge given how late it was. Bakery: TikTok madness. The croissant was sold out by 1pm. It is definitely unique and very chocolate. Worth trying once. Overall: restaurant was okay, but croissant was yum!",

However, compared to the prices you are paying for their food it is very underwhelming. The lemon ricotta pancakes were dry and could not taste lemon. The burger patty was good but nothing special about it esp. when youre paying $28 for it. Also the bun got so soggy. The fries were good. You cannot order pastries that arent listed on the restaurant menu. And there is a huge line for their supreme croissants.",

Then waiting inside for another 20 minutes before finally being seated. The host staff doesn t seem bothered by the fact that crowds of people are standing both inside and outside waiting for their tables.  The first apology we received for the wait was after I spoke to the manager. If you cannot accommodate and honor reservations don t take them. Let s hope the food doesn t suck as well.",

They have a separate bakery if you d just like to grab n  go. Highly recommend this place for sure. The coffee was good as well because it s from La Colombe which is known for their coffee.

We reserved for the patio but it was sunny every table had shades except ours, we kindly asked for the shaded table ? They couldnt accommodate us? There were literally 2 tables with shades and empty. We asked if we could move an umbrella, they literally moved it one cm but didn t help at all. For the food it was pale it took ages. I rated it one star due to the service. I will never recommend it or come again",

The the cheese and Dijionaise paired with it well. However the  burger was pathetically small and coupled with a huge batch of fries to fill you. Unfortunately other than a little parsley on the fries they were unseasoned except for salt, which to me did not justify the $28 for a lunch entree price.",

We had brunch at Lafayette before my husband proposed and it was the perfect start to an incredible day. Sadly, they no longer make my most favorite item - the coveted Banana Chocolate Coconut Croissant. It truly is something that dreams are made of. It s on my shortlist of  Best Thing I ve Ever Eaten.  Sadly they stopped making them with the pandemic. Maybe if enough people request it The brunches are great. Dinner is spectacular. This past weekend we had another stellar meal. We started with the Pain de Campagne with cultured butter and see salt. It s a hearty bread with thick crust and pillowy insides. The endive salad with manchego, avocado and snap peas and poppy dressing was a perfect flavor combo. The Rotisserie Chicken Estragon with morel mushrooms, spring peas and pearl onions is top 5 chickens I ve had. The potatoes from the spit are a must when ordering. Lafayette is on the short list of places we go whenever in NYC. It never disappoints.",

Everything was fresh and delicious. The service was prompt and attentive - the staff works well together taking care of every detail.  I can t wait until my next visit. Highly recommend!",

Gracious customer service when we were running a bit late with the convenience of texting, a really cool, authentic French vibe, and with the experience of spending months at a time in Paris and other parts of France was delighted with the high quality of food and presentation! We shared oysters, salmon Benedict, salad nicoise and really great Bloody Marys with a French twist. Everything was fresh and simply delicious! Will definitely be back next week!",

You can never go wrong here the outside dining is relaxed and well protected from the street. I do miss their outstanding bakery that has NOT returned.  Dont know what they are waiting for.  I dont think I can survive another holiday without the most outstanding Christmas strudel (outside of Vienna) and other pastry delights.",

It is rainy morning and I was able to book an 11:00am reservation (with all breakfast reservation timeslots available, and no ability to choose indoor or outdoor seating). I checked in with the hostess outside and requested to sit outside (the terrace was around 60% empty) and she told me it was impossible because they were fully booked. I said I was only going to have a bagel/lox and coffee with my disabled father and we d be quick anyway (WITH my reservation) and I got a resounding no chance. What the heck ??? It is now 30 minutes later and the tables are still empty. I told the three workers who were staring at me blanky with no apology that I didn t appreciate the compete lack of accommodation. Were they being discriminatory ??  I am so upset, this was appalling front of house behavior.",

Luckily Lafayette had a ton of open space and was able to seat us immediately. The ambiance is great. We loved the booth seating and the decor. The service was good but was a little lacking for such a fancy restaurant. We had to wait a very long time before receiving menus, and then before ordering, and then in between courses, though the staff was very kind when we did interact. We ordered the escargot, pasta with tuna, for dessert the Mille feuille, and each got a drink. Unfortunately the escargot and pasta were both too salty. The mille feuille was perfect- that was a 5 star dessert. And I ordered a margarita and asked for mezcal instead of tequila which they up-charged us for on the bill. Not something to detract stars for but something good to know. Overall we enjoyed the experience and loved the dessert, but the saltiness of the food and the cadence of the service detract a star. Also it was very expensive. $150 for 1 appetizer, 1 entree, 1 dessert, 1 margarita and 1 glass of wine.",

Don t take two culture s foods and create something new and then call yourself authentic French. Stick to the classics because Spaghetti Nicoise sounds revolting for a high end restaurant.

Their desserts and bread are always outstanding - Id say one of the best in Manhattan. Theres consistently new and/or seasonal kinds so I never get bored. During my recent visit I am pleased to find out their food is a lot better than before - a step closer to fine dining. A place to hangout with friends and family and sitting alone is just as good. This is truly a treasure in the neighborhood and a great place to explore for locals and visitors.",

Most of the reservation times were sold out- a very good sign for the health of the restaurant. We started with mimosas, well-made of course, and a simple croissant, served with the classic sides of beurre and framboise jam. Their in-house bakery produces fine pastries and breads. Even though the brunch choices were yummy, we both were drawn to the special  salmon frittata . A fluffy, plate-filling omelette with chinese mushrooms, greens, mushroom reduction sauce, and on top, an egg-sized mound of fresh salmon salad. The cool, classic salmon salad spread over the warm egg was like having breakfast at mom s, if only mom was French and could cook.",

I ended up just ordering a side of eggs, a bagel, and a croissant, since those are the only things on the menu I recognized. I would have ordered something else but no one bothered to help me understand. Also, I recieved barely any service throughout my meal. I was just left alone.

Their avocado salad was like no other salad I ever tried. Wow! Their beet salad was delicious. I asked, and...They fry their french fries in separate oils from other non vegetarian foods. So I tried their French fries with ketchup. I dont normally eat french fries. So they may have tasted way, way, way better than I have had before. But it could be that it has been awhile since I have had French fries. So maybe they always taste great, which is why they may be such a popular item all over the U.S. Or maybe these were just so good that even though I was full, I had to have more. I normally dont do desserts. And I know people use excuses like its a holiday, so I will break my diet. But it was Christmas morning Brunch. So tried their cookies. Some may not have been cookies. I heard family members call them macaroons. But they were very, very, very, very, very yummy. I definitely recommend this place.",

All were very tasty. Oh, also tried the French onion soup and it was wonderful! The sauteed Foie Gras was done up in a very seasonal way, with maple syrup as the sweet accompaniment. Only thing I didnt like was that it was room temperature, as if it was made in advance and sitting around. They very busy, but smooth with the service. It was a tad noisy and somewhat cramped, but overall a nice place. Very good value to, large portion sizes. Would like to come back for a normal dinner sometime.",

As far as my experience here, I d say the food was really good, and so was the ambiance. I would recommend the banana foster French toast; I ve never had anything like it. I could sit here and describe it to you, but I think the better idea would be for you to just go try it - seriously, it s that good. Despite my raving about the French toast, I actually chose the lemon pancakes for my meal. I for sure thought they were good, especially with the fresh berries, but I d have to say they went a little lighter with the lemon than I had hoped for. I must mention, if you do wind up coming here for brunch, you should definitely get a side of bacon because it, too, is really good. I thought the service here was pretty good, but nothing outstanding. Our server was friendly, but obviously busy with other tables. Another thing of positive note is that the restaurant is on the nicer side, but the prices were reasonable (~20 per item) which was pleasing.  I will definitely make this a go to place for brunch now!",

My partner had the omelette with ham and cheese, the omelette was large but the fillings werent very prominent.

To summarize after exchanging emails with them for 2 days, the day of the event arrived and I hadn t received yet the menu (as they proposed) as we wanted to have our food pre order as we were in a tight schedule. I had the call them 3 (!) times and they passed me from one person to the other (total 50 mins!!) and I had to repeat everything again and again to different people because  we are not sitting in the same building . Finally on the last call they told me they could not find my reservation or emails   and that they couldn t accommodate the group 70 mins prior to our original reservation! Still after I had to spell my name 4 times to this lady... 4!!! She called me JENNIFER when finishing the call! Ridiculous. For sure the worst service I ve received in many years.",

From sitting a pre made reservation near the bathroom, to slow service, 1.5 hr wait for food not to mention uncooked fish, over salted pasta and cold mussels. It wasn t until we overly complained that someone stepped in, but honestly it was too late and at 10:30 ( for an 8:30 resi) we weren t willing to wait for things to be recooked. While we didn t pay for the meal, overall the condescending nature of the staff made us feel bad for complaining. What a shame, this used to be an amazing place, but unfortunately I won t be bringing my business there again.",

I had breakfast here, and while my meal selection didnt split the atom (yogurt, granola and fresh fruit), my companion had their Soft Scramble Eggs, chevre, leeks and truffle vinaigrette. It was literally a gently-dressed salad with aptly named scrambled eggs. The eggs were so fluffy, I they were at risk of taking flight like dandelion puffs. The tile floors, wood and twisted artisan metal molding and railings made this restaurant worthy of whatever my bill cost me. Go for soft eggs, stay for the transportation to a forgotten style of living and dining.",

Theres a terrific on-site French bakery and cafe which is what caught my attention first. Sitting down for a light bite in the lovely high-ceiling and romantic restaurant, I discovered their excellent lunch salads, sandwiches and such were actually quite ample (leaving me with a delicious take away box for later). I had the rotisserie chicken salad and an excellent order of thin and crispy frites. The salad was perfect,  also with grains, candled walnuts and more, with a yogurt house dressing. So well-conceived that no other spicing, even salt and pepper, was needed at the table. The staff was gracious and attentive. I tried a specialty cocktail that draws on local geography, called their GREAT JONES SPRITZ, comprising dry London gin, Byyrh, grapefruit, lemon and Cremant de Limoux, that was swell. Id return in a heartbeat for all of it!",

I barely finished half. I highly recommend the Croque Madame, Salmon Gravalax Benedict, and the Bacon Masion.",

We were seated in the vestibule near the entrance, and whenever new guests arrived we were met with a chill. Tldr: get the dry aged duck if available Onto the food: Steak Tartare: was good, not memorable. And for the first time in our tartare experience, we were left with more bread than tartare. Risotto Basquaise: the first couple bites were delicious, but as we kept eating, it tasted more like a fancy pizza sauce with risotto and shrimp. The Serrano ham just tasted like crispy bacon. Would not order again. Black Macaroni: This was spectacular, we absolutely destroyed the dish. The macorni was on point, the lobster and cuttlefish were prefectly accented with crushed tomatoes and garlic sauce. At this point we were stuffed, but here come the entrees. Grilled local trout: The trout was cooked perfectly and accompanied by coco beans and sauce that was not memorable. Dry Aged Duck: THIS STOLE THE SHOW. We were absolutely stuffed, but one bite into the crispy skin and we couldnt stop. It was a perfectly cooked medium rare duck breast with a touch of melt-in-your-mouth duck fat....OMFG. It was accompanied by a delicious butternut squash puree and Foie Gra jus that took the dish to the next level - at this point we just ignored the trout and cleaned the plate. Simply wow.",

                "review_text": "I had a disappointing birthday dinner at Lafayette in October and wrote a review about it.  I am happy to say that I had another opportunity to have dinner at Lafayette and it was a totally different experience. Since there were five of us at dinner, listing the 15 dishes we ordered would not be productive but I can say that each was perfectly prepared, presented and served.  Some highlights were the Frisee Salad, the Escargot, the Trout, the Oxtail Bourguignon  Ravioli,  the Aged Duck and an exquisite pear dessert. We were warmly greeted by Crandell and Tamika. Luis was a very attentive and professional server. Melissa served us dessert and was especially attentive to my grandson. I would  definitely recommend Lafayette for gracious and delicious dining! October review: The food is no better than fair....the ambiance lovely, portion and quality lacking...overpriced for what is served....the desserts uninspired",

Also they sell here very very good bread as Balthazar and bagettes and so on. Visit this place and you will come here again and again.

Today with La Colombe closed at E 4th we saw that they have a cafe and take out coffee. We went to cafe for one latte to go, one to stay and a regular crossaint. All were excellent and seemed no more expensive than La Colombe. French style light buttery crossaint! Excellent latte! Well check out the other reviews and consider eating there. Cafe highly recommend.",

We sat down and I ordered the Nicoise (without anchovies), and I have no idea why but it had the fishiest taste to it. I was with friends and didn t want to make a fuss and was just going to leave the tuna and eat everything else, but then I thought how stupid that was   to pay $30 for a green salad. When I tried to quietly explain that there was something up with the salad, I got a passive aggressive lecture from a waiter, in extremely docile calming tones, about how there was nothing wrong with the salad. He eventually took it away. Then the waitress who had been serving us came back with the salad, again telling me there was nothing wrong with it. In the end I had to say,  I don t want the salad! Take it away! I ended up ordering a burger which was OK. Wouldn t go again.",

Not once did he make us feel like we were asking too much or distracting him from his primary role. The space is charming, but there seems to be some lack of energy around the bar. The restaurant filled up by 1045, so get there early or make reservations. The food was rich and filling. We got one Croque Madame, decaf coffee, and pressed juice. Its pricey, but the service made up for it. A lot of families eat here, so the staff is generally accommodating.",

Im an adult and I can add all the salt I want, but I never would have doused everything like they did. $18.00 for the Gem Salad may be within reason if it was well presented, but this was wet lettuce in a frigging bowl.

Also, the cheeseburger is closer to a slider than an actual hamburger in portion. Just a heads up. Bottom line is at that price point you really have to be able to nail it. And they didnt.

Yes, this venue has perfected the presentation of the food, but don t expect it to be as grand as it looks. The cheesecake crust was too sweet and not good flavor. I ve had better Sara Lee frozen cheesecake at the grocery store. The scone, cookie, and croissant were really dry. Overall, it s a cute place for lunch with a friend because of the decor and presentation of the food, but food is not even close to way the critics described it or comparable to a real French bakery. Completely overrated and disappointing.",

Pretty sure the only reason we got a table was because we kept asking and pointed out open tables we could fit at. Server was non existent throughout our meal, we had to track her down several times to order drinks for the group. When she did make it to the table she was rude and clearly in a rush to leave our table. To top it off the screwed up the bill at the end.",

When we arrived at the restaurant 4 people came in ahead of us without a reservation and asked for a booth to which they were taken. Although I had requested a booth in my reservation which we were on time for we were told that there were no booths available and that we would have to wait for them to clean one off. When we were finally seated we had a very nice booth by the window as I requested. We ordered our breakfast which included coffee. They brought our meals and that was the end of the staff. No one ever came back to our table to ask if everything was OK or if we needed anything. I had to flag down a busboy to get some butter and twice to refill my coffee. I also asked said busboy for more cream for the coffee but that never came . The prices were high but I dont mind paying more if the service is good. So if youre looking for overpriced food in a beautiful setting and terrible service this is the place for you!",

However, it took us a while to get offered water, and about 20 minutes after that until we were even offered any other drinks. At this point we ordered a cheese platter, a sandwich, and a salad. After another 20 minutes, we finally received our cheese platter. It was very good cheeses, although nothing that you would be unable to get elsewhere. It has been another 15-20 minutes since we finished our cheese platter when the server asked if we had ordered food, which is a major oversight and very obnoxious since other tables have been served and cleared in the interim. Eventually, another server said he would check on our food, and nobody seemed to know what was taking so long. Our original waiter eventually told us he was waiting for us to finish the cheese, which is negligent at best (since we were done for a while) and a lie at worst. Regardless, our food came out hot and was very good, although maybe not the slightly higher prices. The atmosphere seemed nice, but we spent the whole lunch in the outdoor seating. Overall, I couldnt really recommend Lafayette. Our service was atrocious and confused, and the food is good but abnormally pricey. Its fine if you are in the area and want some French cuisine, but hopefully the service is better than ours.",

We have been seated to our table fairly quickly, our waiter was efficiant and nice all the time but the food was really disappointing. With my wife, we shared an appetizer ( Grilled Octopus) and a glass of white wine. It was good but nothing incredible for a tiny 20$ appetizer. Lets say it was decent, its NYC, so I can expect it will be a little bit costy. alright, alright. And the bread they served us was really delicious. Then we had a ribeye steak for Entree (it was a huge Entree for 2, it was a a special of the day). It was a total failure... Half of the meat was cooked nicely but the other half was over cooked and all the meat was completely over salty... Even the puree (mash potatoes) done in a Robuchons style was a failure : again, over salty. The gravy, I already forget about it. And I am someone who his eating salty. What a shame for a restaurant.... Serving such an average food. I mentioned it to the server while we were half our way with the meat (yes we were starving !!) and he just said nothing and didnt offer us anything. He just vaguely apologized. At the end, to forget the salt we ordered something sweet : Profiterolle. It was ok. I will not come back to this restaurant . They showed to me they are not trying to do quality food but just running a business and serve average or bad dishes for a high price.",

Ive been here a few times now and I love to just sit at the bar and have cocktails (One reason this bar is great is it falls somewhere between an annoying craft cocktail place where it takes 10 minutes to make a drink and a standard bar where it might not be top-shelf. Great liquors, not a long wait for the 5 minute garnish), or sit inside on a nice date or with a group of friends for a birthday party. I have had a number of dishes here and Ive always loved their delicious menu. Highly recommended!",

                "review_text": "I have been wanting to go to Lafayette for some exquisite, upscale French-inspired desserts for a long time. We finally got to make our way over to this sweet heaven. The inside was nice and bright, thanks to the large window that goes all the way up to the ceiling on the wall facing the entrance. Lafayette is consist of bakery and Cafe, which is more like a restaurant. If you are taking some bread or dessert home instead of eating in, or if you just wanted some sweets and coffee, then you don t need to go into their Cafe. The front right section is the bakery, and the rest of the space is the Cafe. We were only there for the dessert, so we sat at the bakery section. The bakery was filled with all sorts of yummy delight and its smell. We were surrounded with the perfumes of sugar, flour, cream, and every fluffy sweet goodness.  We decided on few things to eat right there, and few other things to take home with. For eating in, we chose Petit Choux, Cascara Slice, and Cappuccino. We got the little shiny treats that looked like jewels. Little jewels that taste amazing.... Our Lafayette experience made us say we wish if we could go there every day. We will get a different dessert, croissant, baguette, whatever they have, and every day we will be happy  But we do have to consult with our tummy, and make sure we can continue to fit into our clothes. So, I guess we can t visit them every day, only in my dreams. Until next time  Read my full review of the restaurant and food on my food blog, foodlovergirl.",

Por ultimo, la salsa de chocolate caliente del postre estaba HELADA (el mozo hasta pregono que estaba caliente cuando la servia) La peor cena de mi vida. Lamentable!",

The trout roe, crispy breadcrumbs, and grated hard boiled eggs on top of the asparagus was delicious. Wonderful beef tartare! Nice and spicy. BF loved the white gazpacho. The cheese course was nice and generous! We had the dessert with the rhubarb ice cream and pistachios cream and pistachio cake. It was gorgeous looking and quite yummy. The main courses were the only weak dishes. The trout with morels and ramps should have been amazing, but was pretty bland. BFs burger was very unevenly cooked. Parts were medium rare which is what he asked for and other parts were almost black and blue. This is great spot for people watching!",

Now before we start the review, i have bad taste buds when it comes to dimsum. You can serve me dimsum in the back of a van and Ill probably still find it delicious. With that said, I really enjoyed the dimsum from here...especially the spare ribs with the black bean sauce. Everything else tastes good, but the star player is definitely the spare ribs. The kicker? $2 per plate Monday-Saturday. Youll see a lot of old folks here on the weekends..and youre probably going to split a table..but for $2, its well worth it. I should also mention that the service here is pretty much non-existent. Yes, the ladies will be pushing their carts...but good luck having them come to your table and ask if you want anything. Gotta be aggressive and flag them down if you want something.",

Lafayette gets five stars for the French country rustic decor and vibe it seemlessly executes.  Tile floors and backsplashes, wainscoting, and warm gold/ brown/ white tones soften the metal hardware of the light fixtures, rails and handles peppered throughout the space.  The outdoor seating is ample and spacious, though the interior was something we were pleased to experience. Drinks and food are both excellent in portion  (almost surprisingly so since its upscale French) and execution.  Cocktails run about $13-15, but quality spirits, a generous pour, and service with a single large cube made it seem fair.  I savored the Vermouth Amelie with a soft, mildly sweet taste of dark liquor and citrus.  The lamb tangine left me awestruck from service (presented in a covered Moroccan patterned dish) through each savory bite.  Pieces of lamb simmered slowly in eastern flavors with chunks of carrot and other veggies (seemed like a cousin of zucchini but I couldnt place it) left it soft as butter.  The couscous was flavorful, and  served with toasted, slivered almonds, and a midly salt and garlicked yogurt. My mom had the wood grilled trout.  While my dish was heartier and fit for a chilly day or to serve a hearty appetite, the trout was reminiscent of light Spring flavors.  It was the type of meal youd truly enjoy eating, but then feel good inside and out for good clean nourishment. Of course there was dessert to the tune of a salted caramel mille feiulle.  The pastry was impossibly thin and flaky, and the caramel was fantastically real - not some melted high fructose corn syrup junk melted just long enough to serve.  We shared it and loved every second of it.  The only culinary downside for the evening was the bitterness of the coffee. So much good but only 3 stars.  Service was obviously figuring out its operation while we were there.  Our first waiter dropped off menus, but was quite slow to return for drink or food orders.  We had to ask for bread once our meals were served (we had bread plates, so knew it existed), and also for our water glasses to be refilled.  Once they got the memo, they were more attentive.  Four different waiters helped at some point or other, but they didnt communicate with each other making us have to repeat requests for things a few times.  They were wonderfully friendly and patient, but at a restaurant of this caliber I expect service on point. Prices are around $15 for appetizers, $10 for sides, $22-25 for pastas $33-36 for meats & fish, and $15 for dessert. Ill certainly visit again!",

Wine list was excellent- much better than the bar list, but then it is a French restaurant. There was a little concern over food allergies, so if you have any, let them know before you order anything. They were very accommodating and even remade several things without those ingredients for those guests. The chicken was good, the fish was excellent. The octopus was delicious and I kept sopping with the sauce. Salads were good but not outstanding. The desserts (chocolate cake, fruit tart, and ice cream) were marvelous. The chocolate came out on a hot board. So good. Great for a date or group. Atmosphere is a little dark but quiet enough that you can hold a conversation without raising your voice.",
