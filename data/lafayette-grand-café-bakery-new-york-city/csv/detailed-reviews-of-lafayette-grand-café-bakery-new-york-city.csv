No. Even though I enjoyed it, $10 for a pastry is overpriced. You pay for the aesthetics. I can t deny this vday limited supreme is cuter than their regular ones. The croissant is huge - share one with your friend so you pay $5 each, girl math. Oishii Berry is expensive, so you can also convince yourself paying more for good strawberries. 2. How long did I wait? 10 mins before they started selling the last batch (4pm) on a Friday. Don t waste your time if the line is too long. If you have never tried Lafayette s viral croissants and been wanting to try for the hell of it, go ahead. The hype is dying down. You never go wrong with Oishii Berry, and this collab is 100% instagrammable. Oui Love Oishii Supreme We read many bad reviews about their supremes, but this February special went beyond our expectations. The pink white chocolate top glaze was overly sweet so we scraped it off. The two Koyo berries were good but much smaller irl. Mediocre croissant - it was neither buttery nor flaky, perhaps that s how their supreme maintains the perfectly round shape. Yuzu creme was right up my alley, very creamy and citrusy; while the Koyo berry compote tasted fresh and natural, unlike some sickly sweet jam with artificial flavoring.

We waited in the line for over 25 minutes (which was fine) but the staff member who was outside was rude and kept disappearing and never gave straight answers about what happens next. We decided to just go into the bakery because there were no further instructions on how long it would take. We then found out that there was another long line inside that nobody outside was aware of. Everybody was just waiting outside in the cold expecting the line to move as per what the staff member told us. The  famous  croissant was mediocre at the best. If you re carving out time from your busy schedule just for trying it, I d strongly suggest that you skip it and go to a cafe that actually respects the customers that keeps their business alive.

Is it worth standing in line for an hour? No, absolutely not. But I passed by it in the morning and saw a very short line, so I had to try it out, and it was fully worth the short wait. The circular shape is more than a gimmick. It exposes all the layers equally to the hot air in the oven, resulting in an even crunch. The crispy shell and velvety filling complemented each other. The custard was on the sweeter side, but it became the right amount of sweetness with the plain croissant dough.

Admittedly, it was an unconventional choice for me, but it proved to be a revelation. The buttery layers melded harmoniously with the rich, nutty pistachio, elevating this to the pinnacle of croissant desserts I ve ever savored. Following this act was the cinnamon cronut, which was very good in its own right, with its sweet, spiced layers offering a satisfying crunch. However, it was overshadowed by the sheer excellence of the croissant wheel. Lafayette Bakery has crafted a lineup where even their standard offerings shine, but if you have to choose, the croissant wheel with pistachio is an absolute must-try.

We also understood that bakery items could not be ordered from table service. 8am came and went with no communication to the line that had formed. We finally approached asking when the Bakery would open at 8:07am and were informed they were delayed and it would be a few more moments. My husband stayed in line while I went to sit at the table. I observed 3 new training servers starting on a Saturday. Our server was the same gentleman who we approached at the door. He took our order and mid-way through our service disappeared to man the bakery, no communication just left the training server to check on Us.

It was so uncomfortable after I made my purchase and wanted to eat it there. You can only be seated if you say you are going to eat brunch or get a cocktail. I said I would buy a drink to get a seat and I was constantly being asked if I was gonna order food even if I had just bought their bakery goods. They made me feel so uncomfortable. Keep in mind I made line to get the filled crossiants and asked if we could eat it inside and the worker said yes. I legit had to say i was getting a cocktail to be seated and once i sat down i got a coffee instead (which i didnt finish) and ended up leaving 10 min in . Coffee was bad and the crosiants were not good at all . Not worth the wait or money. Just the hype of the pictures.,4 months ago,2023-11-02 21:12:51.334271,Im sorry to hear about your visit to the bakery Jomairi - its truly not what we strive for.

The service provided was deplorable, characterized by staff who seemed to wear their rudeness as a badge of honor. Simple amenities like napkins were noticeably absent from the tables, leaving guests scrambling and helpless in maintaining a clean and enjoyable dining atmosphere. Finding the restroom turned into an unintentional game of hide and seek, with zero signage to guide the way and staff too discourteous to assist. When inquiring about the location, the response received was not directions but instead, an undeserved bout of yelling. Moreover, the glaring absence of service personnel on the floor meant that getting assistance or asking questions turned into a daunting challenge. The only semblance of kindness and professionalism could be traced back to the bar staff, who unfortunately seemed overwhelmed and unable to manage the floor. My experience reached its nadir when I, unable to locate a trash receptacle and finding no staff to assist, left my leftovers on a waiters station. This action was met with public humiliation as a waiter - a rude, middle-aged, heavyset man - decided the appropriate response was to yell across the cafe, attracting the unwanted attention of all present. Though I apologized, the sting of embarrassment and the bitter taste of regret lingered far longer than it should have. Date & hour of visit: 3 Oct, 10:00 AM. This bakery is a minefield of unprofessionalism and a gallery of how-not-to-treat-customers. If being treated like refuse is on your agenda, by all means, step in. Otherwise, consider any and all alternatives as a better choice for your patronage. This establishment not only failed to meet the basic standards of hospitality but seemed to actively disdain them.

The creamy, and smooth texture of the pistachio is to die for, especially with the nuts on top of the croissant, takes you to paradise.

ChIJBVtTt5pZwokR48CgdYqHma8,Lafayette Grand Cafe & Bakery,d2b9c1e8752a61fd95bde7a3d19b8fa5,1,"What a shame to Lafayette and the French Culture! One of the worst restaurants to ever exist in New York. Disgusting and late food, mid atmosphere, and rude understaffed servers that made an overall insulting and humiliating experience for my entire family that ruined our trip to NYC this Summer. Here are the details. The Asian girl server was so rude taking our order, and had us wait for about an hour until we checked with another server (bc she never came to check on us), just to hear that our order was never put in. We were so mad but we re-ordered since we wanted to try the Benedict. And about ten minutes later, the manager told us that the Kitchen used all of the Hollandaise sauce for the day and that we have to put in a different order. Almost an hour after we arrived at the place, we ordered medium well steak and rare tuna salad. Which we waited for ANOTHER HOUR. We waited for a total of two hours waiting for one of the worst steaks I ve ever had   too salty, all I taste is pepper salt, red as rare, tasteless and chewy to the point where my jaw ached. Got there at 10:30, left at about 1:20 with a day ruined. And the worst part is that the manager put the bill on the house, yet, never got a single apology from the Asian server that took our order in the first place, and all the other staff who gave us an attitude and words saying  don t bother since we are paying , as well as a Spanish worker who laughed at us and mocked us when we were leaving the restaurant with disappointment. Servers don t have their designated table sections, which means we had to talk to over five servers before getting our disappointing first food after two hours. Will never recommend to my fellows and will share this disappointing experience forever. Want to give zero star if possible.",7 months ago,2023-08-02 21:14:29.221033,Thank you for sharing your feedback from your most recent visit at Lafayette.

I also didn t like the croissant to custard ratio, too much custard too little pastry. Even if it was $5 I would not repurchase for that reason, although I wonder if pistachio one would be better.

So, why not try em out? Also, HEADS UP: get there EARLY* Their line forms rather quickly. I got there around 8:30am and there were at least 20 ppl already in line. But DONT WORRY, the line moves along rather quickly. This location is easy to find by foot/uber/public transit, etc..This is also an eat-in Cafe displaying a great layout; with a wise way to split the dine-ins from take-outs. They offer indoor and outdoor seating (perfect for warm days*). Great staff, both very kind and thorough.  I went for the croissants, but being there..I saw so many other delicious-looking options!! I left with 2 of each croissant flavor.. Lafayette did NOT disappoint. You cant find some of these pastries just anywhere.

Particularly their breakfast since Ive only been here for that. Ive had the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, the bacon maison, and scrambled eggs. Drink wise, the coffee could be better, however the hyper c and French rose were great! Why the lost a star? Theyre known for the speciality crossaints, however I think its ridiculous that Id have to stand in a long line just to order it when im going to be sitting for breakfast. Youd think there would be an option to at least order at the end of my meal as a to go option.

Our encounter with Jose, our assigned waiter, left much to be desired in terms of courtesy and professionalism. From the onset, Jose interrupted our initial waitress, who was already attending to our table, only to embark on an unsolicited lecture about the distinctions between still and tap water after a simple request for water. Such unnecessary condescension left a negative impression. Moreover, when my mother inquired about the various types of croissants available, Jose responded by curtly suggesting she approach the bakery stand and ask the question herself. A more accommodating response could have involved acknowledging the available options, such as chocolate, pistachio, and traditional, while advising her to verify their availability at the bakery due to high demand. Unfortunately, his response lacked tact and carried an undertone of insolence. A similar encounter unfolded when my father sought clarification on the relative strength of the latte compared to the cortado. Jose responded with a sarcastic smile and uncalled-for rudeness, generating an atmosphere that made us feel somewhat guilty for not being well-versed in coffee intricacies. It is disheartening that the excellent potential of this cafe was overshadowed by the conduct of a single staff member. In order to cultivate a truly exceptional dining experience, it is crucial to ensure that every member of the team exhibits professionalism, respect, and a commitment to customer satisfaction (and most importantly, manners).

With that said, we did go at the 8am opening on a Tuesday and manage to score the croissants with just 3 people ahead of us. I sure am glad I got to try it. It is flaky, soft buttery and the pistachio cream is divine. Yes, I would buy these again if I m in NYC and I don t have to wait hours in line. The chocolate one is more dark chocolate cream than milk chocolate but it was still delicious. We also did ate breakfast and everything was refine.

They only serve it at 3 times 10am - 12pm - 4pm We waited more than 1 hour in line. Honestly, its not worth the price or the time to wait. The only thing that was worth it was the experience. They put on a lot of show for little, in Brazil Im sure well find much tastier and better quality croissants. We were the first in line, and the graduate that they say would leave at such a time is just a marketing strategy. Because the croissant we ate didnt come out at that time, it was cold and hard, it looked old, like it had been made the day before. I thought it was a lack of consideration for those who wait so long, they delivered that type of croissant. If I could turn back time, I wouldnt waste my precious time in New York, to eat him. Im not saying its bad, it was good. But nothing much. I wouldnt go back there, because I know I find things much more delicious than it. Nothing extraordinary.

Fizeram muito show para pouca coisa, no Brasil tenho certeza que encontramos croissant bem mais gostosos e com mais qualidade. Eramos os primeiros da fila, e a formada que eles dizem que sairia em tal horario e apenas uma estrategia de marketing. Pois o croissant que comemos nao saiu aquele horario, estava frio e duro, parecia velho, que tinha feito no dia anterior. Achei uma falta de consideracao com quem espera tanto tempo, entregaram aquele tipo de croissant. Se pudesse voltar o tempo, nao perderia meu precioso tempo em New York, para comer ele.

The choices were pistachio, chocolate, or banana cream. I got both the chocolate and the banana cream and both tasted super rich and delicious. The banana cream one was slightly better for me personally so I d definitely recommend that flavor.

Made a reservation as a surprise for a friend to enjoy mimosas and pastries only to be told that if you sit in the restaurant, you cannot buy any of the pastries from the bakery aka the famous croissants that we came here for. The concept doesn t make sense to me at all and nowhere does it say that to get anything from the bakery, you have to stand in line and won t be able to dine in or vice versa. Disappointing as we ended up ordering the  pastry basket  on the restaurant menu only to be told that they gave two pastry options and no basket-  a regular almond croissant, not the bakery one and a scone.

I expected a higher level of service and better quality food especially given the price tag this place carries. We came for dinner and I must say I liked the vibe of the place very much - jazz music subtly playing, intimate French decor, dimmed lights, stunning bar - all on point! Plus the staff was very well dressed, something I enjoyed very much and wish to see more in a similar type of restaurant! However the rest of the evening, including the food, drinks and service was a let down. We ordered two French wines, but they were not good in taste - I understand that might be personal preference but all 6 of us agreed on that. Over the course of the night we had multiple waiters and they seemed out of sync - they kept forgetting to fill our wine glasses and it came to the point we had to proactively call one of them to refill the wine, they tried multiple times to take our plates away even though we were not finished. When it comes to food, the bread served with butter was good, but the crust of the bread was heavily burnt and tasted like charcoal. I only had a french onion soup which was not my favourite - very beefy with actual chunks of beef and very little onion. Normally I dont have a problem with any of the mishaps written above, but I would not expect them to happen in a restaurant where I paid nearly 100 USD for two glasses of wine and two soups! I still want to try the bakery, but I will not be visiting again nor recommending this restaurant to anyone! Atmosphere **** Service *** Food *** Paid by card.

While it was good, I was underwhelmed, especially seeing that the line for these croissants snakes around the corner on weekends. The croissant itself was not too sweet, which was a plus for me, but it was a bit on the dry side. The pistachio cream was delicious in the top half of the croissant and lacking on the bottom half. While I wouldnt necessarily go out of my way to wait in line for this croissant, I was glad to have been able to check it off my list.

The restaurant itself was packed to the brim, with a queue stretching out the door and around the corner, reminiscent of the crowds at Everest Basecamp. However, it seemed that the popularity of this spot was driven more by New Yorkers insatiable desire to be trendy and relevant rather than the quality of the dining experience. Unfortunately, this lack of service is becoming an all-too-common trend in New Yorks dining scene, with many popular spots neglecting the basics of hospitality. The tipping culture and lack of attention to detail are leading to the downfall of proper dining, which is a true shame for those who love the art of dining. Even though Lafayette offers a delectable croissant, it cannot excuse the lack of service provided. In fact, this cult following should be an embarrassment to the establishment itself. Its disappointing to see a restaurant prioritize its image over the satisfaction of its guests, as it ultimately leads to an unfulfilling experience. As someone who values a proper dining experience, I hope to see a shift in the New York dining scene towards an emphasis on service and hospitality. While good food is certainly important, it is the experience as a whole that truly sets a restaurant apart.

I thought the food was excellent and was so happy that one did not have to go to Paris to eat exquisite quiche, omelette and  pastries etc. I immediately came back this Valentines weekend with the other two Hazelnuts and recruited 4 more friends to have brunch at Lafayette.

Let me begin by saying the supreme croissant was very good. We were able to acquire 2, one which we ate immediately, the other we ate 4 hours later. It held up well. In fact, I thought it tasted better eaten later when the filling was not as oooey gooey. The frittes that came with the croque madame was also very good. The boulangerie basket was as good as I remembered, it was gone in an instant. My husband ordered the quiche which I had raved about all December long. It was just mehhh this time.

I have never had the opportunity to try it out and, to be honest, that does not sound too appealing to me: in my opinion, a croissant must be shaped like a   and, most of all, it must be plain! (or it s a cornetto ) But again, when we arrived in NYC, we didnt know anything about the city anymore, so we checked on the Internet. I looked for salty food and my wife looked for sweets (well, I did look for ice creams and doughnuts myself, to be fair) and she found Lafayette, the original  inventor  of this round pastry (they call it Supreme, btw, but it s  a croissant). First, we had to queue (under the rain!) for about 20 minutes to get inside just to order to go... While we were queuing, we could see through the Windows all the content creators inside showing a camera how much they were enjoying their Supreme: sad. Once inside, I was amazed by... the darkness of the venue. I couldnt even see what I was ordering. Honestly, I knew what I was coming for, otherwise, I couldnt have known what to order... they dont want us to see what we eat? Thats a shame because, when I got used to the darkness, I could guess that the venue actually looked very nice. I sincerely dont know why they dont turn the light on. So the clerk at the counter told us about the 4 flavors available that day and we picked pistachio and the seasonal: Supreme de Noel. I must say that the pistachio Supreme was very good, at least the half where there was cream. The other half was just like a regular croissant, a good one but nothing from another world either. The Supreme de Noel was not that good, the cream was too thick, I guess to make it seem like an actual buche but that didnt fit the Supreme so much. Dont get me wrong, it was not bad, but for $10 a piece and a 20-minute rainy line, I expected way more. I would trade this for a good croissant or a pistachio cornetto anytime.

I initially heard about Lafayette through various food blogs that were raving about their delicious take on French cuisine and baked pastries. Upon my arrival to Lafayette, I was stunned and a bit intimidated by the supremely long ling wrapping around the corner block to get into the restaurant and bakery. Once my party and I were seated at a snug booth table, we ordered their boulangerie basket of pastries, brunch brisket burger, lemon ricotta pancakes topped with berries, a croque madam, and a round of cold brew. Additionally, we lined up to get their highly rated pastries from the bakery (of which their signature pastry, The Supreme, a kouign aman-esque take on the famed French croissants) was not available for restaurant guests to feast on. For good reason, the resto-cafe had a long history of guests making reservations at the busy cafe, only to order The Supreme, and nothing else. Now, onto the food review, the cold brew was bland and frankly, quite bitter. The tray of assorted pastries were unremarkable and were not worth the $25 listed price. The brunch brisket beef burger was tender, juicy, and surprisingly well seasoned, the accompanying fries were fantastic. The croque madame was simply bland and its only redeeming quality was a generous serving of ham for its filling. The lemon ricotta pancakes were equally mediocre asides from the copious helping of assorted berries. Finally, with regards to the pastries from the bakery, myself and my party felt that many of the items were too doughy, overbaked, and simply not worth the wait. However, the service and staff was on-par with a restaurant of this quality, the waiters were attentive and helpful. Plus points for the beautiful decor and exceptional waitstaff team. If I were to sum up my experience at the Lafayette, I would simply say that it is overhyped standard French cuisine fare.

The raspberry danish was very good, the danish was flaky and you could tell they used real butter and the flavor of the raspberry filling was just enough not to make it overwhelming. The spiral croissant honestly was a let down. The lamination was not that great, I am wondering if they used real butter for it, and the cream in my opinion was way too much and did not have the best of flavors.

Delicious peeling like few others and the amaretto not at all stomach-churning. Everything changed on the second day. For some strange reason, the rules of the place do not allow breakfast to be served if you do not strictly take what is written on the menu, so we were rudely kicked out from the mezzanine floor and had to re-order. We were drawn here by the photos of the different flavored cinnamon rolls, as they looked very intriguing, but that was the beginning of the end. The very good pastry was irremediably ruined by the various toppings: a mousse that didnt taste like chocolate, a pistachio cream that had nothing pistachio-like and finally a coconut cream that actually tasted like lemon.

They dont let you order the croissants even if you have a reservation for brunch. 2. They only allow each customer to order maximum one croissant. Its obvious that they dont care how far the customers traveled here, how long the customers waited on the line outside, and how customers feel. 3. We waited outside for an hour, then we were told that the croissants were sold out when it was almost our turn. This is so unprofessional. 4. Their brunch tastes ok, but the portion is pretty small, plus its quite expensive. The service is ok. Overall, an overrated place. In my opinion: Whoever made the croissant rules needs to see a doctor. The establishment should allow leastly 2 croissants to be ordered for each customer, considering the long waiting time and the potential risk of a customer who has never tried their croissants and ordered a wrong one by mistake.

Also, the restaurant itself is cozy and our waiter and the wait staff were nice as well, despite how long it took to receive our food.

We were so excited to try this place only to find out they were closed for a private party. We came from staten island to come check this place out. The menu looked delicious. When we got there the door was wide open so we walked in and thats when they told us it was closed. I asked if we can get something to go and she said again were closed. The party was downstairs  the whole upstairs was empty so I dont get why we couldnt order something to go. Also there were empty tables outside. I guess they got it like that and they dont need the money. As I turned to leave a line formed behind me with many shock looks of dismay and disbelief. Also they could of posted on social media to let ppl know.

I went years ago for my friends 30th birthday and have been several times since. The food has always been delicious. But, after my last time coming with a group for a prefix brunch I will never be coming back. This restaurant is rude and has a complete lack of communication and customer service. I reserved a table for 14 on their online booking app. 14 was the max I could get, however our party was for 15 so I requested 15 in the notes. But I never heard back confirming they could do 15. All communication from them said 14 so I assumed they couldn t do it and our group size changed accordingly. They even confirmed 14 via text the day before and I did as well when I confirmed our reservation. During the brunch the food took forever. One of the couples in our group had to leave after two hours to make a flight and the entrees hadn t even come yet. You d think for a family style prefix the food would come regularly. The coffees didn t come until halfway through the meal. Then the bill came and we had all been there so long we were rushed to leave and we just signed and left. After reviewing the check later, they had charged us for 15 people after all that. $75 pp and we had only 14. Since they don t have a phone # to actually speak with someone, I emailed and asked for a refund. After a week of going back and forth they finally refunded me the $75 but didn t refund me the tax and tip for the extra person. This is absurd. I shouldn t have to fight for a refund for an extra plate when we never had a group of 15. Any restaurant with good service would have called me to discuss this like I requested several times and they would have rectified the situation immediately. Lafayette never even apologized and blamed me for the whole thing saying  for the future, we require 24 hours notice for any changes in party size to Chefs Menu.

Luckily Lafayette had a ton of open space and was able to seat us immediately. The ambiance is great. We loved the booth seating and the decor. The service was good but was a little lacking for such a fancy restaurant. We had to wait a very long time before receiving menus, and then before ordering, and then in between courses, though the staff was very kind when we did interact. We ordered the escargot, pasta with tuna, for dessert the Mille feuille, and each got a drink. Unfortunately the escargot and pasta were both too salty. The mille feuille was perfect- that was a 5 star dessert. And I ordered a margarita and asked for mezcal instead of tequila which they up-charged us for on the bill. Not something to detract stars for but something good to know. Overall we enjoyed the experience and loved the dessert, but the saltiness of the food and the cadence of the service detract a star. Also it was very expensive. $150 for 1 appetizer, 1 entree, 1 dessert, 1 margarita and 1 glass of wine.",2 years ago,2022-03-02 21:19:07.104956,,,,1,58,165,True,,

I ve walked by here many times, and I ve always wanted to try it, and I m glad that I finally did. As far as my experience here, I d say the food was really good, and so was the ambiance. I would recommend the banana foster French toast; I ve never had anything like it. I could sit here and describe it to you, but I think the better idea would be for you to just go try it - seriously, it s that good. Despite my raving about the French toast, I actually chose the lemon pancakes for my meal. I for sure thought they were good, especially with the fresh berries, but I d have to say they went a little lighter with the lemon than I had hoped for. I must mention, if you do wind up coming here for brunch, you should definitely get a side of bacon because it, too, is really good. I thought the service here was pretty good, but nothing outstanding. Our server was friendly, but obviously busy with other tables.

Tldr: get the dry aged duck if available Onto the food: Steak Tartare: was good, not memorable. And for the first time in our tartare experience, we were left with more bread than tartare. Risotto Basquaise: the first couple bites were delicious, but as we kept eating, it tasted more like a fancy pizza sauce with risotto and shrimp. The Serrano ham just tasted like crispy bacon. Would not order again. Black Macaroni: This was spectacular, we absolutely destroyed the dish. The macorni was on point, the lobster and cuttlefish were prefectly accented with crushed tomatoes and garlic sauce. At this point we were stuffed, but here come the entrees. Grilled local trout: The trout was cooked perfectly and accompanied by coco beans and sauce that was not memorable. Dry Aged Duck: THIS STOLE THE SHOW. We were absolutely stuffed, but one bite into the crispy skin and we couldnt stop. It was a perfectly cooked medium rare duck breast with a touch of melt-in-your-mouth duck fat....OMFG. It was accompanied by a delicious butternut squash puree and Foie Gra jus that took the dish to the next level - at this point we just ignored the trout and cleaned the plate.

Luis was a very attentive and professional server. Melissa served us dessert and was especially attentive to my grandson. I would  definitely recommend Lafayette for gracious and delicious dining!

I made a reservation ahead of time and requested a booth. When we arrived at the restaurant 4 people came in ahead of us without a reservation and asked for a booth to which they were taken. Although I had requested a booth in my reservation which we were on time for we were told that there were no booths available and that we would have to wait for them to clean one off. When we were finally seated we had a very nice booth by the window as I requested. We ordered our breakfast which included coffee. They brought our meals and that was the end of the staff. No one ever came back to our table to ask if everything was OK or if we needed anything. I had to flag down a busboy to get some butter and twice to refill my coffee. I also asked said busboy for more cream for the coffee but that never came . The prices were high but I dont mind paying more if the service is good.

However, it took us a while to get offered water, and about 20 minutes after that until we were even offered any other drinks. At this point we ordered a cheese platter, a sandwich, and a salad. After another 20 minutes, we finally received our cheese platter. It was very good cheeses, although nothing that you would be unable to get elsewhere. It has been another 15-20 minutes since we finished our cheese platter when the server asked if we had ordered food, which is a major oversight and very obnoxious since other tables have been served and cleared in the interim. Eventually, another server said he would check on our food, and nobody seemed to know what was taking so long. Our original waiter eventually told us he was waiting for us to finish the cheese, which is negligent at best (since we were done for a while) and a lie at worst. Regardless, our food came out hot and was very good, although maybe not the slightly higher prices. The atmosphere seemed nice, but we spent the whole lunch in the outdoor seating.

We finally got to make our way over to this sweet heaven. The inside was nice and bright, thanks to the large window that goes all the way up to the ceiling on the wall facing the entrance. Lafayette is consist of bakery and Cafe, which is more like a restaurant. If you are taking some bread or dessert home instead of eating in, or if you just wanted some sweets and coffee, then you don t need to go into their Cafe. The front right section is the bakery, and the rest of the space is the Cafe. We were only there for the dessert, so we sat at the bakery section. The bakery was filled with all sorts of yummy delight and its smell. We were surrounded with the perfumes of sugar, flour, cream, and every fluffy sweet goodness.  We decided on few things to eat right there, and few other things to take home with. For eating in, we chose Petit Choux, Cascara Slice, and Cappuccino. We got the little shiny treats that looked like jewels. Little jewels that taste amazing.... Our Lafayette experience made us say we wish if we could go there every day. We will get a different dessert, croissant, baguette, whatever they have, and every day we will be happy  But we do have to consult with our tummy, and make sure we can continue to fit into our clothes. So, I guess we can t visit them every day, only in my dreams.

Lafayette gets five stars for the French country rustic decor and vibe it seemlessly executes.  Tile floors and backsplashes, wainscoting, and warm gold/ brown/ white tones soften the metal hardware of the light fixtures, rails and handles peppered throughout the space.  The outdoor seating is ample and spacious, though the interior was something we were pleased to experience. Drinks and food are both excellent in portion  (almost surprisingly so since its upscale French) and execution.  Cocktails run about $13-15, but quality spirits, a generous pour, and service with a single large cube made it seem fair.  I savored the Vermouth Amelie with a soft, mildly sweet taste of dark liquor and citrus.  The lamb tangine left me awestruck from service (presented in a covered Moroccan patterned dish) through each savory bite.  Pieces of lamb simmered slowly in eastern flavors with chunks of carrot and other veggies (seemed like a cousin of zucchini but I couldnt place it) left it soft as butter.  The couscous was flavorful, and  served with toasted, slivered almonds, and a midly salt and garlicked yogurt. My mom had the wood grilled trout.  While my dish was heartier and fit for a chilly day or to serve a hearty appetite, the trout was reminiscent of light Spring flavors.  It was the type of meal youd truly enjoy eating, but then feel good inside and out for good clean nourishment. Of course there was dessert to the tune of a salted caramel mille feiulle.  The pastry was impossibly thin and flaky, and the caramel was fantastically real - not some melted high fructose corn syrup junk melted just long enough to serve.  We shared it and loved every second of it.  The only culinary downside for the evening was the bitterness of the coffee. So much good but only 3 stars.  Service was obviously figuring out its operation while we were there.  Our first waiter dropped off menus, but was quite slow to return for drink or food orders.  We had to ask for bread once our meals were served (we had bread plates, so knew it existed), and also for our water glasses to be refilled.  Once they got the memo, they were more attentive.  Four different waiters helped at some point or other, but they didnt communicate with each other making us have to repeat requests for things a few times.  They were wonderfully friendly and patient, but at a restaurant of this caliber I expect service on point. Prices are around $15 for appetizers, $10 for sides, $22-25 for pastas $33-36 for meats & fish, and $15 for dessert.

The octopus was delicious and I kept sopping with the sauce. Salads were good but not outstanding. The desserts (chocolate cake, fruit tart, and ice cream) were marvelous. The chocolate came out on a hot board. So good. Great for a date or group. Atmosphere is a little dark but quiet enough that you can hold a conversation without raising your voice.",9 years ago,2015-03-02 21:22:44.172324,,,,0,94,,True,,
