Bad news is we got billed for the $8 draft. My experience at other restaurants that bill you incorrectly, they usually comp the item. Also noticed the recommended gratuity on the check was the total meal with the tax. I think restaurants really need to do better on this.

Unlike many new Thai places Ayada tastes extremely authentic like when I used to visit my Thai friends home as a kid. Getting the right spice balance with all the aromatic elements especially not ruining the coconut milk lightness and Thai basil is what I am happily pleased about. My wife had drunken noodles with salad and a roll; the drunken noodle were perfect and the peanut sauce on the salad was an exciting twist to a familiar flavor. We started with crab cakes which were a nice sized Ap. Then also got mussels which were delicious with there house made tangy zesty spicy green sauce. Thai iced coffees and lychee drink were huge for large which we also enjoyed. We over stuffed our selves with mango and sticky rice which also did not disappoint. I had forgotten that their mango was tough like papaya with a nuttier deeper sweeter taste than a mango from the americas. Overall the service and atmosphere were accommodating and quaint.

Their mango salad is a true standout, with its delectable combination of sweetness and refreshing tanginess.

One dish that consistently wows me is their tom yum soup, a fragrant and harmonious blend of spices and ingredients.

Its like crack! Ordered the large and shared amongst the 4 of us. Also ordered the spring rolls, Drunken Noodles chicken and red curry chicken. Loved the first two. The red curry wasnt thick enough, and we didnt appreciate the flavor. Staff seated us right away and visited frequently to check on us. Had to prompt for water refills, though. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Food service time was perfect. They asked about spiciness level when ordering, and it was on the mark. My wife and I like it hot, but our guests dont. In terms of ambiance, its a cute place decorated Thai style. The bathroom is nice, but there is a single occupancy. Price is inexpensive for what you get in NYC. Weve been here many times over the years, and the red curry chicken is the only dish we have ever disliked. Tried so many things on the menu. Free street parking typically takes only a few minutes in the area, but you may have to park a few blocks away. We parked a half block away.

However, my experience with Ayada was totally disappointing. Wife got the seafood mango salad, which is her favorite dish. I got the Crispy Duck Panang curry, which was recommended by the staff. The seafood mango salad dressing wasn t well balanced as it was too salty. You could hardly taste the mango at all, which is a huge disappointment because the main point of the dish is the fragrance, sweet and sour flavor, and crispy texture of unripe mango. Seafood wasn t fresh and they didn t cook them well enough, probably to try to get a certain chewy juicy texture. But I would say that was a bad move and I didn t really want to eat the seafood. The Crispy Duck Panang Curry was much worse.  First nothing about it was crispy.  The meat was too grainy. It s like the meat was old or wasn t stored properly and got bad before it was cooked. Or maybe they cooked it for too long. The texture of the rice was too soft and wet, melting in your mouth in a weird way. My first impression when I tasted the rice was that it was old and low quality. Pretty awful since rice doesnt come with the Duck Panang Curry and you have to pay for it separately. Additionally staff never checked up on us to ask if we needed anything else or whether everything was fine.

While the chicken itself was average, the curry base was excellent in both. The problem I have was that while the musselman carry had a good amount of curry base, for some reason the panang had literally about half the curry liquids, not enough to eat with the bowl of rice. I showed The waiter how low the curry sauce was and asked can I get a little bit more to make it the normal serving size, and they said sure I will bring you extra sauce. I should have been cute on to the word extra as that is typically when restaurants see an opportunity to charge you for something which you dont realize is being charged until you get the bill. lol Thats exactly what happened here they brought a bowl of sauce which was much more than I needed and then there was a $4 up charge on the bill at the end. This totally ruined the meal for me considering the dish was low on curry sauce from the get-go. I was with other people so didnt make a scene so this review is my protest. I feel bad giving this low review because again the food was decent and the curry sauce excellent (creamy and flavorful). but then again what good is excellent curry sauce if they dont give you enough to finish the dish with rice? hopefully this review helps improve their consistency and customer service attitude.

Get the duck panang curry, it was the bomb!! Location: It is located in Woodside, Queens. The restaurant is a little bit small but with seatings indoor and outdoor. The interior is okay, you will came here for the food and not for the ambience. lol Service: The servers are nice, they gave you good recommendations even though I know what I am going to get. Food: All that we ordered was delicious, they had big servings as well so we couldnt finish it even though it was so good. DUCK PANANG CURRY: this is a must! The duck was fried or roasted then they add the panang curry on it. OMG the best thai food I ate! FRIED FISH with MANGO SALAD: what a good pairing! The mango compliments the fried fish! Fish is huge and taste fresh. CHINESE BROCCOLI with CRISPY PORK: the broccoli was cooked perfectly. I like it when it is medium cooked, crunchy. CALAMARI: it is fried and not crunchy which I liked cause I want the squid to be still soft. PAD THAI: it was delicious, the noodles were cooked al dente, and I usually get it with PORK. THAI ICED TEA: it was not that sweet and silky smooth drink, I hope there is boba on it tho. LOL. Price rating: 6/10, cheap! I thought it will be expensive but the price is not bad.

But it s in Queens, I don t go to Queens   Since it was a short working day today and I already had the car out, I decided to brave it.  Turned out that Elmhurst QNS is  the nexus of New York s Thai community. To my surprise it even had parking.  . At the street corner of Ayada there were at least 4 more thai restaurants.  I was in Thai heaven.  As a warm up, following the reviews, I ordered the Raw Shrimp Salad.  It came with some hot concoction on top of each of these raw crustaceans, and if it wasn t hot enough, a raw halved garlic clove was placed on each.  The Papaya salad with seafood was next.  That was an absolute explosion of flavors.  Sending varied flavor particles everywhere in my mouth.  At the end, I found myself gorging on these flavors with a table spoon hunting it s last drops.  While I really couldn t eat much more,  I had to try a curry dish.  Surprisingly, I chose the green curry and since  variety is the spice of life . I surprised myself and ordered the duck this time  . This place was definitely Thailicious.  So who have won  the Best Thai Award  so far?  Well, as my daughters like to say, they all won    .

Here and I have been here several times for lunch, always a great meal at a reasonable price. She, like many others in the lunchtime crowd here, work at the local hospital. The other day she went for lunch by herself.  Her meal was great as usual.  The bill came, for a total of $13.95.  Great lunch specials. Not having any cash on her, she went to pay by credit card.   The server informed her that she couldn t use her credit card unless it was for a certain minimum charge.  She was also told by the server that there was an ATM next door. This isn t good business for several reasons. The first reason, it s illegal to refuse a credit card for any amount.  A business can say that you must have a minimum charge ( the law is $10) to use a card without incurring a fee.   But a business cannot refuse a card. My fiance, not wanting to be confrontational being that she is a regular customer here, went to the ATM.  It is one of those out in the street bodega ATMs that charge the cardholder a fee to make a withdrawal. I m not saying she or I will never go here again.  The food is great, prices reasonable, service always friendly. Maybe the server was new and not aware of the ways credit card laws work. But any charge over $10 should have been accepted by credit card payment by any business. In this day and age more people use charge cards than cash. Hopefully this can be addressed for the best interest of this great business and its  regular customers.",4 years ago,2020-04-24 16:15:12.879514,,,,0,4,,False,,

Prices are fair, but across the street (a walk-up Thai place), you can get a better deal but with less selection and no full service. Overall, if you are new to Thai food, you cannot go wrong at  Ayada. For seasoned Thai fooder, it could be a refreshing find. My favorite (not pictured) was the papaya salad with raw crab in fish sauce.",4 years ago,2020-04-24 16:15:17.031952,,,,0,106,84,True,,

Noodles were good, but pad thai is a delicate balance of sweet, salty, and sour, but the pad thai I had seemed to be a little light on the salty and heavier on the sweet, with a hint of sour.  Perhaps it was an off time?  Not sure, but I was definitely expecting a higher standard considering its Elmhurst and theres Thai food everywhere. The chicken wings were very crispy and cooked well.  The sauce was a typical thai sweet chili, so I had no complaints there. Overall, Ayada seems like a solid thai option and I would come back again to try their other dishes.

I read a few reviews saying that the place was small so I was a bit worried about the seating situation but was pleasantly surprised. Firstly, the restaurant is split into two (Im guessing both sides are open during rush hours) and on the half that we were seated in, we were comfortable. The seats arent that close and there is enough room to squeeze between tables and sit on the other side of the table. Its a very cozy place and the food is absolutely amazing. I tried the Thai Iced Tea - a little on the sweeter side but nonetheless refreshing. Their menu is extensive and inexpensive so your party can go ahead and order a few things to share. They also list the spice level (and ask you) so you can adjust it to you taste. Only downside is that they only accept a max of two cards to pay - not a deal breaker but can be a bit inconvenient if youre going with a large party of friends.",5 years ago,2019-04-24 16:15:22.593046,,,,0,23,8,True,,

We had the worst experience of not having the proper food but was asked to tip very properly. We were not even provided with any of the sides for the ordered food and you need to ask them. You will be treated well if you are ordering more. One of the customers near our table were questioned whether they are going to order anymore, when they said NO immediately the person who served brought the cheque to them. You will be treated well until you make the cheque. They will always be ready to keep you out for which they stay near you and once you are in they look at you whether if you are there ordered already and then only you will be served with water. We explored many foods in New York and this is one of the worst experiences we had. The other shops we explored in Chelsea Market didn t have the mandatory tip though their services were too good. But here you will be treated good or bad based on the food you order which was totally disappointing. The customers next to our table have ordered less and seeing their experience we didn t have the thought of ordering any more. You have many best restaurants with better serving in Chelsea Market, NY and in the cities but would highly not recommend this to anyone. Please don t visit the restaurant. Never had such a worst experience anywhere and got to learn that we should check in the reviews for the tipping as well.

I ve had the massaman curry (average taste but very aesthetic) and summer rolls (bland but works well with the creamy sauce) that I enjoyed over a nice classy ambiance. Yesterday I drove 1.5 hours with special friends to give them the experience I enjoy. I really hyped it up, we were hungry and looking forward to it. Online it says they close after 9 but when I got there around 3:30, the moment we stepped inside they shooed us away saying they re closed and to visit their smaller restaurant in Chelsea market. Well we go sit there (less aesthetic, loud disco music) and I try ordering my tried and tested items. Well despite it being summer in June, they didn t have summer rolls. Everyone s majorly disappointed at this second setback but they figure since we re here let s just order something. So we order the massaman curry. You ll see an image attached with the floral vegetables of what I ve always had, comes with a pita bread ($36~). And then you ll see an image of what they served us yesterday. Completely different look, taste and presentation. Came with rice instead of bread. The menu was the same, item was the same so I ordered the same thing. When I show the server my picture and ask, they explain that original menu item was discontinued and they serve this knockoff instead. How misleading!! The menu should ve been updated, there should ve been signage somewhere to indicate items may differ but no nothing! And this dish was $18! Incredibly overpriced for what it is, didn t taste good. Despite my negative experience, they offered nothing, no apologies or anything to compensate for my waste of time and horrible experience. I was so embarrassed in front of my friends.

We decided to have a cocktail at Ayada while we waited to our reservation for Oyster happy hour at Cull & Pistol. We were greeted by a fantastic bar tender and a lovely cocktail menu.

The best cocktails we had during our week in NYC and probably the best cocktails I ve ever had. Our call for Oyster happy hour came quickly so we didn t get to enjoy our cocktails as long as we anticipated so we told the bartender we would be back for another after oysters. Now go get this. We eat Oysters and I go to get my wallet to pay and it s gone. Of course my heart and stomach just sink. I must have left it on the bar at Ayada. It s long gone I m sure and now I m screwed. I run over and am quickly greeted by their team and presented with my wallet. They totally saved the day!! We came back and ordered two more cocktails, the green papaya salad, spring rolls, and two shots of tequila to calm our nerves. The Conga ended up being our favorite cocktail and the green papaya salad was the best we have ever had and we order it all the time. It s extremely flavorful and spicy!

We were standing in front of the store to get seated only for a waiter to come over to us & pointed two empty seats to sit & not using his words. For the first 10 mins of our service, the waiter just used hand gestures or eye contact to  communicate  us. I just thought it was really rude. He didn t check up on us either. When we were about to pay, it totaled 69.70  dollars so I paid 70 dollars in cash, while I was trying to find a hundred dollar to ask them for a change. He came over to us and asked us  was the tip included?  I understand it might seem like I wasn t tipping but I was going to. (I worked in the restaurant industry for years before college so I already understood how the tipping is really beneficial for restaurant workers.) but that was the only time I ve heard him spoken in full sentence. That made me wondered how can he expect a good tip with a bad service. I usually tip servers 20% or even more because I empathize with them but this time, I couldn t help but tipped him 15% only.

His recommendation for Leo thai beers were a slam dunk. They were light and refreshing with chilled glasses. The chicken dumplings came in 4 and definitely held me over until main course, I appreciate how they took out the shrimp for me. The beef curry dish was spicy but phenomenal, the flavors and seasoning all complement one another and portion is perfect! I loved my basil fried rice with meat of choice , chicken was chopped finely and it was also mega spicy as I wanted but was not over the top and it had so much great seasoning . All of this for 60 dollars was well spent and a memorable experience. I also appreciate the beautiful decor from statutes to fine china and beautiful outdoor seating too with flowers and private booths.

I have to say, Im super disappointed. First of all, the menu is much smaller at the Manhattan location, leaving of some of the more interesting dishes. The new locations menu is a typical, commonplace Thai menu. The food isnt bad everything tastes fresh and is well prepared but its not as good as the Queens location. When Ive ordered take-out, Ive noticed that the staff has a very consistent, deliberate and somewhat scamming way of encouraging you, with a slight but noticable bit of pressure, to click on the 20%   26% tip buttons on their credit card reader, always with the directive, Click below and then click enter.  The fourth or fifth option is Custom amount. Their pressuring approach and omission of all the options in their verbal instructions, makes it feel as if they want you to click 26% before you realize that there are other options. They also hover over you, watching to see what youre clicking.  They make it feel as though they are trying to give you the impression that it is commonplace to give a 26% tip for take-out. Nuts! Also, their suggested tips are based on a post tax total. Shady! If you think Im playing too much into this, I suggest the reader read on to some of the other poor reviews to read about this restaurants suggested tip policy for dine-in. They seem to have some shady policies. Thirdly, Ive worked in restaurants before, so I understand that there is a strong desire on the part of both management and wait staff to turn over tables, but one of the things that one learns as a waiter is that people dine out partly to enjoy a night out with friends, chatting, enjoying each others complany, and that its totally inappropriate and terrible restaurant etiquette to ask your customers to leave because you need the table (especially when the restaurant isnt that crowded). The staff at Ayada probably care less about their customers because management thinks that that most of their customers are tourists and will probably never come back anyway.
