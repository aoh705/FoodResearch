I arrived, and I was greeted by the lovely manager Tina, she geared us to the bar while our table was ready, and recommended some great drinks, it was less than a 5 minute wait! When I say the eggplant and garlic appetizer was out of this world! The flavors were so unique, and just outright delicious. We then ordered the tiger prawns, which was a surprisingly large serving, topped off by the mint and cilantro cream, I was licking my fingers, after, the pot of lamb with basmati rice, felt like we were eating in someones home eatings moms cooking, topped off by delicious milk dessert, I couldnt have picked a better place to dine. The service was great, all my food arrived right after the other, the servers were so helpful describing every dish, and breaking it down for me. The manager Tina checked on our table, always made sure we were having excellent time.Just the ambiance of the entire restaurant, everyone enjoying the food/music, makes you remember why NYC is so great!",

The host said she could seat us but needed my phone number in order to do so. I did not feel comfortable giving out my personal information. I relayed this and asked why she needed it. She said just because she needs it. It was clear she didnt know and was just following protocol. However, a second employee piped in and said it was for covid contact tracing. That program ended in April 2022. If you are collecting personal information you need to state your intent in using it. I did not end up eating here. Very bummed and frustrated by the experience. Did not feel like a friendly restaurant experience but rather a website with pop up ads. I hate giving bad reviews on here but this was disappointing enough to warrant it.",

Would say the apps are shareable up to 3 people, could do 4 but might only get a small portion. The entrees as shareable up to 4. The Lasooni Palak app was by far the best of what we tried followed by the baingan bharta. The Gobi Angaara was ok and seemed like it wasn t cooked all the way through, seemed rushed and marinade was still raw. The Paneer Nawabi was good as well and worth a try - paneer is fresh. The paratha is a sizeable portion which was good to see. For desert I would say you can skip the pista cream it s just a pistachio custard. The kulfi was tasty but very small size for the price - not much of a value. The neembu pani is a worth a try but it could do with less chaat masala",

Both the paneer tikka and gobhi angaara were packed with flavor, but the gobhi was a true standout. I ll be dreaming of the way they cooked that buttery, spicy cauliflower for the rest of my life. The lamb biryani was also well worth the hype. The lamb easily fell off the bone & its fatty flavors seeped into the rice, complimenting some of the more acidic elements of the dish. I would definitely return to Dhamaka! For more food reviews, follow my instagram @chloenicholle.",

But if you do like spicy and appreciate strong flavors, there s nothing not to enjoy at this restaurant. This is not the stereotypical North Indian food that people are used to in the US, but instead the restaurant pulls influences from different regions in India. There s also a pretty good wine and drink list. Always have a great time when we go and will be back again",

For $75, I expected a culinary masterpiece, but it fell short of even average expectations. Its clear that the hype surrounding Dhamaka is just that   hype. Save your time and money, folks. There are plenty of other Indian restaurants in the city that offer far superior dishes. Dont bother with this overrated establishment.",

It took them 30+ mins to get 2 entrees which was annoying. Almost felt like they wanted us to keep ordering drinks which is why they delayed bringing out the entrees. - Wanted to end with dessert but again, they had run out of it and had no options available. I wouldn t recommend this place or go again myself ! I don t understand why they are solid booked so far in advance.. it s not worth it.",

The chai was okay and was luke warm. Should probably be called  not so garam chai . We also tried the hariyali egg dish. The dish was cold for some reason. The scrambled egg tadka that they add on the table was hot but the sunny side up and the green sauce that the egg was sitting on was room temp. This made the whole dish cold while eating. When we told the server that the dish was cold (just to inform them and not to get a free dish or something) she said the green sauce is stored in the fridge and then added to the plate to straight without heating it. She said she will relay this feedback to the kitchen. Not sure if that s how it s supposed to be but we were not fans of Luke warm food. We ordered chapati which came in really hot and compensated for the cold egg. Overall the experience was okay. There was spice and flavor in everything but lacking in a few areas. We do want to try the dinner menu so might change this review then.",

Ambiance is decent, atmosphere is slightly noisy and music is acceptable. But you can easily have conversations in the loudest setting. Staff and service is top notch. Really efficient and knowledgeable. Those who cook good tasty Indian food at home, you ll not feel the difference, so don t even read the full review and just stay at home or go some place else who ll give good experience along with decent food. I would have been disappointed even if Nalli Biryani cost 1/3rd of what it is. In my visits to this place, I have tried majority of their current menu but nothing has wow d me. For rest of you, continue on.. Food is pure and authentic, you ll really feel at home. No fake curry and sauces. Paneer is made in house and is worth a try for vegetarians. Each of the rice dishes are unique and distinguishable including Nalli Biryani (portion size is large, 3-4 people) and Kolambi bhaath. For Rajasthani khargosh, you ll have to place an order 2 days ahead. Kashmiri gosht chap and lasuni lobsters are good apps. Everything on the menu is worth a shot. Skip the kulfi, will recommend the Rabri. Limited selection of drinks. Goan gangster was unique. Good place for family and friends get-together.

Its really hard to get a reservation here so after booking a month in advance it was great to sit at a table for two and have plenty of space to dine comfortably. Bollywood music was playing overhead and overall the place had a great vibe. SERVICE Also great! Our server was attentive and gave recommendations on the food when we asked him to help us choose between two dishes. FOOD Okay so here is where my qualm starts. The food was good. Here is the breakdown solely on flavor: Papri Chaat (3/5): The spice level was great but the papri was very strange... it was super thick and hard and difficult to eat... it didnt soak in the yogurt like it should have Prawn (4.5/5): The flavor is great. However, even though it looks quite extravagant its really only 2-3 bites of deliciousness. Paneer (3/5): The dish itself was pretty oily (similar to a few other dishes judging from other reviews) and there was strong flavors from mace and methi which could be a bit overwhelming in certain bites. Dessert (4/5): Came warm which was unique. Im used to cool desserts but I loved the burnt edges of this dessert. I could have excused the food given the excellent service and the vibes. But the price! $14 for the prawn is a bit outlandish. The dessert which was a rice pudding-esque dessert was $12. We ordered a mango lassi and it was $9 (!!?). The raita on the side is also $3. Overall, I thought the food was good. But Id rather go to somewhere in Flushing or Jackson Heights to get similar quality food at half or third the price. Was I happy I came here to check out the hype? Yes. Will I come back? Probably not unfortunately.",

Way overpriced and hyped for the quality of food served. Ordered 5 types of appetizers and three main course dishes. Not a single item tasted good. Fish fry was too salty, chaat was just bowl full of sev with tamarind, paneeer in the tikka was bitter. Veg biryani was extremely spicy with no flavors, proportions of rice, vegetables and spices were totally off along with huge amounts of potatoes. Black pepper chicken was the worse- it was unappetizing, no meat (bones only) in a horrible looking sauce with bad taste. Paraantha was the only time which tasted good and felt authentic. Four stars for service as they brought food on time.",

Below average poor food quality, ambience, servers are ignorant and don t care about customer satisfaction. Not adequately informed of Indian cuisine or ingredients. They bluff their way through and fool the young Gen-Z customers by distorting traditional Indian recipes. Menu is extremely limited with no flexibility for customization. Manager was nonchalant and didn t care much. The chef needs to learn how to cook- i can teach him how to make Fish Amritsari ( nothing but greasy fried fish) Chicken ( all bones, barely any meat)Baingan Bharta( oily and almost burnt ) & Dal ( flavorless, basically boiled lentils) Bathroom was dirty and there s only one all-gender bathroom for the entire restaurant. Long lines are unacceptable, but unavoidable. Regret my decision to dine here with family. Worst experience ever. Hate to even think that they call this Indian food. **the dishes mentioned below were not in the menu. How are you even asking to recommend this??",

First time there and it was totally awesome.  The most important thing is to tell your server you know nothing of this food and they will explain it all to you so you know what to get.  Our server was Azad and he was awesome.  We ended up with the Papdi Chaat which is an app that is full a flavor and not too spicy.  For main courses we had the goat neck and the mutton (mutton is just an older sheep).  Both were fall off the bone yummy with awesome flavors we had never tasted before.  Really good.  Azad said the mutton was an 8 out of 10 hot but if you have the spicy sauce at a Mexican joint you will be ok with Dhamakas 8 out of 10.  The goat neck was a 6 out of 10 so not too spicy but really yummy.  They only have one dessert which is like a cheesecake.  It is really good but it is small so you may want to get 2 of them.  No hot drinks here but several coffee shops in the Essex Market where Dhamaka is located.  We will be back again for sure because we want to try some more of the things we saw.  Apologies that we do not know what they were!!!  Check out all of our reviews. If we do not like it we do no review it so all of the ones you see are places that are fantastic. Follow us if you like. We had over 36 million views so far this year and we thank you for that. We dont get paid, we just love to eat. Be sure to click on RobH at the top of this review to see all of them and to follow us if you like good food and FUN.  If we do a review it is because we love it.",

The baingan bharta was ok, it tasted very different from a normal version and you had to order roti or paratha separately. This was odd for an app, since apps should usually arrive as a full dish. Mains: we ordered Paneer Methi, Gobi Korma and the Vegetable Biryani. All three were delicious. They were on the spicier side, which we liked, but was surprising. Service: The staff needs to be trained better. They were nice, but lacked some basic training. We had to keep asking for our water to be refilled. We had to ask for our plates to he changed between appetizers and entrees. When refilling the wine, they didn t change the glass especially because the 2nd wine was a different one. Overall, given how expensive the restaurant is and the standard it sets, the experience was quite disappointing.",

The roti wasn t cooked properly and I could see the raw dough. I had a 5 pm appt( first customer of the day) and yet for some reason their containers in which they serve chutney was only 1/8 full( too little to share between 3 ppl). They also tried to seat us by the bathroom when literally all the tables in the room were empty. Pepper chicken was average. Baingan bharta was genuinely delicious and smokey. We ordered mango kulfi for dessert and its size was a joke. Rabri was good. I really don t understand the hype about this place. NYC has better Indian food",

The place is called Dhamaka which in their staffs words means  Explosion . Instead of explosion of taste, it is explosion of disproportional spices in the name of Indian food. The whole food is just garam masala, garam masala and garam masala. The meats were not tender and juicy, were mostly chewy and rubbery. Lassi was literally liquid sweet cream! There is no other flavour in the food. And the funny thing is their own staff saying it s not the best biryani or food! It s overhyped and wayyy tooo pricey. We paid 450$ for 4 people and it was painful not because it was expensive but because we paid soooo much money for bad food. Also, we had made a reservation, still waited for 30 minutes to be seated!",

Food is only spicy with no flavor multiple mistakes were made with our food order, we never got our drinks but they were on the check also we were charged for items we didn t even order. Pathetic experience with mediocre service at best. Pricing was average except for a couple of items were ridiculously expensive and not worth it because I could tell the quality of meat was not worth the price. Sadly they are only sales focused and have no idea about hospitality. This  restaurant doesn t live up to the hype, it does live up to its the tagline UNAPOLOGETIC which is appropriate because they don t care about their customers. Don t waste your time trying to get a reservation plenty of great Indian restaurant with exceptional service and food. The ownership doesn t realize that if one aspect is lacking but other aspects are on point most people would appreciate the business. They are sadly a over hyped destination I would stay away from as this is not in any way a guest focused business.",

We ordered the Amritsaril Fish Fry, Afghani chicken, Paneer Methi, Dal Panchmel and paratha. The mains were flavorful but the small bites were lacking. In my opinion, its overpriced & underwhelming.",

Gurda Kapoora: These were delicious and, gotta say it, the best testicles ive ever had! Chapli Kebab: this was good, but probably my least favorite of what we ordered Nalli Biyani: Incredible and definitely the highlight One big shoutout is for the Ghee Wiz (check to make sure this is the one that comes with the smoke). The entire table was blown away by this cocktail. After trying the other ones, I would say this is really the only one to get.",

While the restaurant does proclaim to be  unapologetically Indian  (presumably matching authentic Indian tastes), I believe that bumping up the spice level of every menu item doesn t do Indian food justice either. We ordered Dahi pakodi chaat and mutton rara. The mutton rara was justifiably spicy, and tasted amazing!! Also should mention that the chapati and paratha were really soft.. The dahi pakodi chaat was way too spicy with finely chopped chillies, and I could not get any other notes (sweet,savory,tangy) that I expect from a chaat. Since I m not a big fan of spicy food, I may not come back for a second visit. But do recommend for someone who can take the heat!",

We are both vegetarians, but there are enough vegetarian options on the menu. We stsrted with the Paani Puri, which were made table-side and were divine, and we also shared the Dahi Pakodi Chaat, which was so good that we ordered another portion of it. Our main course was the gobi korma, also very good. Warning: most of the dishes have a serious kick to them, but if you like it spicy (we do!), then you ll love it. I ll be back for sure.",

The dish itself said it contains tiger prawn but what s in it is shrimps that slightly bigger than my finger nails. The crab was not fresh also but processed crab meats instead .

We had requested for a high chair for our toddler on the reservation and it was setup and ready to go when we walked in - that was a nice touch and seamless. We ordered the papdi chat, paneer sandwich and chicken sandwich. All of them tasted great albeit more spicy than we would have liked. Chapati on the side helped calm down the crazy heat. The chai was overall good, but again too heavy on the spices in our opinion. Overall an awesome experience and great food. Vegetarian options: Has quite a few vegetarian items Kid-friendliness: High chairs available, but no kid menu. And most items are spicy so not really geared towards kids.",

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Dhamaka, and I was very impressed with the food and service. I had the chicken tikka masala, which was also excellent. The chicken was tender and juicy, and the sauce was rich and creamy. I also tried methi Paneer which was delicious. I  highly recommend Dhamaka to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic Indian dining experience. The food is excellent, the service is top-notch, and the atmosphere is inviting.

The service is downright horrendous. Most of the food is extremely greasy. Example the Gurda Kappora, there was no meat. It was all oil. It is poor mimicry of the original dish. All the dishes are extremely two dimensional and lack deep flavor. The prices dont justify the service/quality. The service is terrible not only do they forgot to get some of our items.

The paratha bread unlike any other paratha I tasted: very flat, but still flaky and buttery. The goat belly was presented neatly, and while it was tasty, it was the least original among the entrees I tried. Im hoping to try more of the menu soon. Service was really fast and the staff was very friendly. It is a bit loud between the music, the people, and Delancey Street, but not unmanageable.",

The short rib dish is a glorified short rib patty, and was not that great, you cant taste the egg yolk amidst the spice or oil so whats the point? The corn dish disappoints, its a sticky consistency with sweet generic corn kernels. The rotis are nothing like a traditional roti. The appetizers are small, not delicious, and most are > $20. The prices for the mains ($40 - $75) are absurd even for todays restaurant inflation. We wouldnt return, and are big fans of Semma (sister restaurant) so we were quite surprised and disappointed by both the food, atmosphere and overall experience. The restaurant needs better ventilation; even seated outside one is overwhelmed by the smell of the kitchen (I grew up in an Indian kitchen, its not something that typically bothers me). There is only one single serve restroom for a restaurant that seats over 50. That makes little sense, too.",

From the chapli kebab to the paneer methi to the big pot lamb biryani, everything was delicious. To top it off, they had an amazing wine list and super friendly staff that walked us through the entire menu (maybe a bit too much word vomiting tho). Unfortunately, the portions, especially on the appetizers, are extremely small. If youre coming with a party of 4+, consider ordering two portions instead, otherwise everyone will have just a tiny bite. The curry and biryani were more meant to be shared. But even still, we left somewhat hungry. Id say this is more of a spot for a party of 2, and maybe read up on the wine list beforehand ;)",

Chicken Biryani came with raita that is at most two spoons. When we asked for more raita, another two spoons was served with about 4 dollars added to the bill. Shame.

Food is by any measure overrated and rather pretentious.  The dishes were overindulged with the richness of ghee and every one of them had too much spice both quantitatively and qualitatively.  We ordered a spiced potato  and eggplant appetizers, the chicken kurma and the biriyani.  Clearly these are all pretty traditional dishes and anyone s expectations would be that these be really good and be done extremely well.  I have to say I can think of multiple family members who would have each created these dishes with much much more authenticity and flair. I apologize for the harsh critique. As a typical reviewer I am more prone to leave happy feedback rather than negatives ones. However, i was so happy to find this reservation after multiple previous NYC trips and attempts and I am so sadly disappointed after such high  expectations.",

                "review_text": "WORST RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I had a horrendous experience at dhamaka and judging by some of the other reviews, Im not the only one. The problem is not the food. It is the management and the attitude of the host. This review is specifically for the manager Tina Dholikar. Im horrified that such a acclaimed restaurant would hire someone this devoid of common courtesy and manners. We were late for our reservation by 15 minutes due to the traffic and Tina refused to seat us. It was a full restaurant and food coming in for the tables and yet she refused to seat us. We had asked for the manager at which she said that would be me, I know I dont look like it, but I am. Indeed she did not sound or look like a floor manager who knows how to talk to customers. She went on and on about how it would be disrespectful to the chef and his time and yet it was perfectly fine that we wasted 30 minutes rushing to get to our reservation. She spoke back to us three separate times. It is perfectly fine for a manager to say that they cannot accommodate a guest as they missed their reservation but there is a way to do it. Being antagonistic and rude to the customer all the while making a huge deal blaming them for being late is not the way. We then asked if she had a business card in case we needed to get in touch with the owner, she replied sorry, we dont like to cut trees. I then said those are basic marketing materials to which she replied we are looking for a certain type of diner and are not trying to market our restaurant to everyone. Im sorry, but this is beyond acceptable and she would be fired on the spot at any other decent restaurant. I get that your restaurant is enjoying good reviews now, but having horrible staff like this really makes your restaurant look very undesirable. There are a million restaurants in NYC and no one needs to come to dhamaka. We ended up going to a wonderful Indian spot that did accommodate us and was very courteous. We will be sending everyone there. I would really prefer to not waste my precious holiday time writing a review, but it was beyond rude and sorry, but awful attitude like this will only beget aa very negative reputation. Read your comments- several have also commented on Tinas attitude. Sorry, but your restaurants reputation is worth a lot more than a staff member.",

                "review_text": "I had a terrible experience at Dhamaka earlier this week and am noticing that all the recent reviewers are noting similar experiences. From my observations, it seems there is a really poor manager whose complete lack of professionalism is impacting other staff and the overall service. The protein in one of our dishes was inedible. I ve had this dish previously at Dhamaka and ordered it again because I really enjoyed it. Since we couldn t eat the dish, we mentioned it to our server (who seemed new and really uncomfortable and uncertain throughout the entire visit, even before this point). The server went to relay our feedback to management and then came back to the table and inexplicably started arguing with us, telling us the dish was fine. We again politely explained that the sauce was flavorful but the protein was off and we couldn t eat any of it (it was basically just bones, no meat, and the tiny shreds of chicken were either severely overcooked, or undercooked, we couldn t even tell because it didn t resemble chicken in any capacity). After another back and forth of her going to speak to the manager, and a long awkward pause where no solution or apology was offered (the normal response at a restaurant of this caliber would be to replace the dish with something else, comp a glass of wine, offer us dessert .something/anything other than being argumentative), we reiterated our feedback and the server again began arguing that the dish was fine. As our plates were being cleared, the server inexplicably asked if we d like the food boxed to take home. No, no thanks. At this point, we asked that the dish be removed from our bill, because it was clear that Dhamaka had no interest in rectifying the situation. The sever had to ask the manager, and then came back and told us there was nothing that could be done since we had eaten the food. The same food that she had just offered to box up for us 2 minutes prior because there was so much left. At this point, as she picked her third argument with us, we just wanted to get out there asap and as we were leaving, mentioned the situation to another member of the staff who basically shrugged. On the walk out, I will note that one kind staffer pulled us aside and apologized, but said they weren t empowered to help because of the manager. But made it clear they realized what happened and how terribly the situation was handled. The Unapologetic Foods group should really take note of what s happening at its restaurants and get  management  some hospitality training asap. Based on the recent reviews, and our own experience, the reputation they ve built in NYC is quickly unraveling and it won t be long before word of mouth has a significant impact on their business. I won t be giving any future business to Dhamaka, Semma, or Adda.",

                "review_text": "Dhamaka used to be our favorite Indian restaurant in the city. They changed the menu in April of this year and so disappointed in those changes. Came here last night to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. Our favorite dish was always the Goat Neck Biryani ($33). With the new menu changes, they switched our Goat Briyani ($33) to Lamb Biryani (Now $75!!). The dishs price more than doubled even though Lamb is cheaper than Goat. We decided to try something new and ordered the Champaran Meat. The main ingredient in this dish was a whole garlic. The dish unfortunately was over powered by the garlic and we could not taste the Indian spices we hoped for to compliment the garlic. Overall disappointed with these changes and will have to look for a new place to get goat biryani",

That being said, I was a little disappointed! As others have mentioned  the food was too spicy!! I m Indian & am used to spicy food but at the same time I recognise that most Indian dishes do not need an insane amount of spice/heat unfortunately this kind of ruined the experience. The entree portions were enough for 2 ppl but not more, while the appetisers were small. The dessert was good but $12 for a spoonful of rabri is a bit much. It was an interesting experience but I m not clamouring to go back.",

The food is good, there are a lot of good flavors, and the atmosphere and servers are really nice. We shared the beguni which was fried eggplant and at this point I was super hungry so this tasted great. The sauce that comes with this dish was great. Next came the paneer methi and the goat neck biryani. The paneer definitely tasted house made and you can taste the difference. They didnt skimp on the portions either which I can greatly appreciate. The biryani was a degree spicier but is still doable. Overall we had a fun time and were able to take leftovers home but with the price, hoping that would have happened anyways. I would come even to just enjoy Essex Market which is fun in of itself. Plan ahead and get a reservation to properly enjoy this restaurant.",

For 21$ sandwich, you get two pieces of bread drenched in grease without any side or accompaniments.we couldn t even eat the sandwich as it felt like we were sipping oil with every bite.The portion sizes are ridiculous for the prices that they are charging. Rabri toast was another huge disappointment again topped  with dollops of white butter. Being an Indian and vegetarian I would n t recommend this place to anyone.

The worst part of this place is the service, they did not make any sense in explaining why they can t seat 7 people by pulling up a chair to a 6 seat table  when the restaurant was half empty at 11:30am and other tables were not booked. They made us sit at the bar and offered really subpar service. Would not recommend.",

The menu was very limited and few of their menu items were not available. They have a weird rule that you can only order main course items all that you want together once. Their portion sizes are very small compared to the price charged. IMO it s very expensive. The paneer tikka from grill section was for $21 and they only serve 2 pieces of it. Food is delicious no doubt but is also that much oily! I don t think I would ever go there again. There are other Indian cuisine restaurants that serve similar delicious food and are reasonably priced. Please see pictures for reference. Vegetarian options: There are a limited options e.g. the Handi/Pot section which lists the curry s has just two options Paneer methi and Gobi korma.",

We ordered the kali mirch korma, paratha, roti, chapli kabab and kashmiri ghosht chaamp. We couldn t differentiate between the Kabab and Ghosht because both had appetizer portion sizes. The korma had great portion size but you have to dive in multiple layers of oil! We wanted to try the Biriyani since it looked less greasy, however the portion size was too big for two people, would be nice if they had a an option for half the portion. The paratha was fried! It was crunchy like a snack and i did not understand why! Had to send it back and still received it semi fried the next time. Really disappointed for the hype. Otherwise they had great service, very friendly staff and a really good ambience. Would not recommend the place for food!",

The parathas were crisp and the rabri at the end was a perfect end to our rather elaborate meal. Good service , the music is a bit loud for me , but I get it since the name of the restaurant is Dhamaka*. Loved the experience we met the chef later and he was very approachable and friendly.

We ordered the Baingan Bharta and Paratha so can use it to dip. Then the Afghani chicken and Champaran meat. I love the Afghani chicken. Its very juicy and buttery. The champaran meat is listed as spicy but I find it ok. You do get a kick in the after taste and best to order rice with it. They also have a cart for dessert which is very unique but we didnt order any since we werent hungry. Its inside a food court so seating is tight. They do have an outdoor space. Its best for 2 to 4 people. What I didnt like was it was a little past 9pm and there were a few empty tables but they sort of asked us to leave to free up the tables when there was no one waiting for a table. I like that it is also close to the train station so makes traveling convenient. Vegetarian options: They have alot of gluten free , vegan and vegetarian options.",

It can be overwhelming so do be careful about expecting a specific result when it comes to the food. We had 3 sides and 2 orders of rice. The Aloo Dhamaka is good very well roasted. Has a good kick of spice. The Chapli Kebab was amazing and had a great amount of flavor. Would recommend this to start off. Probably my favorite dish of the night. The Nagaland Pork is good but very fatty. So if youre not into fatty things I would stay away. Otherwise, its not as flavorful but definitely had a good taste. The Nalli Briyani was simply amazing. They have a lamb chuck cooked, and when they open up the pot, it literally slides off the bone. The Kolambi Ani Kekda was good but definitely will feel more seafood like. So if youre looking for a better approach for seafood can go with this type of rice. If not I wouldnt recommend it since it will be an explosion of seafood taste. The drinks I would probably say are on the more expensive side but I feel like its only good to order for the experience of trying out their alcoholic mixtures being different. Is it worth over $20 per drink? I dont think so. Maybe if it was like $15 like majority places, Id consider it. It was a great overall experience. Staff knew what they were doing when handling the dishes and service with customers. I did enjoy the vibe of the restaurant and the workers seems to enjoy what they do as well.",

                "review_text": "Absolutely the best Indian food Ive ever had. We had a waiter named Azad who did a great job explaining the menu as well as giving recommendations. He recommended the Paneer Methi over the Paneer Tikka and he was 100% correct with his recommendation. Our party destroyed that Paneer Methi. If you have a server named Azad just listen to his recommendations he will not do you wrong. The other items were just as plentiful and just as tasty. We got 3 orders of the Biryani because of how flavorful it was. Of course, with food of this quality, the service and atmosphere were just as fantastic. The employees are very kind, down to earth, and personable. This restaurant absolutely deserves the Michelin Star it received and I will be getting another reservation soon to come back a second time.",

At first I was a bit thrown off by the  loose custard/ pudding but not yogurt  consistency, but after the second bite- I was like hell yes!",

The dishes are unique, delicious and served uniquely but I don t think it justifies the price. We tried the afgani chicken which didn t look or taste anything like afgani chicken I ve had back in india and tasted ok. Methi nu gota was awesome. Methi paneer and paratha were the best and must try. They make their own paneer and I ve not had a similar dish anywhere in usa. Veg pulav was good but nothing special. Drinks are unique and interesting. Rabdi was awesome and another must try dessert. Overall a good experience but it still seems overpriced. It s located inside the market. They have one restroom in the restaurant and more in the market. Ambience is casual and service is just amazing. Would like to go here once again to try few more dishes to get a better idea.",

We ordered three curries (Gurda Kapoora, Kali Mirch Korma, Paneer Methi) all contained a ridiculous amount of ghee.  The waitstaff seems to anticipate comments on the level of oil in the curries - mixing them at the table and quickly stating it is not oil, it is ghee.  If was dining here again I would order a good mix of dry and sauce based dishes.  Otherwise the meal would be too heavy to enjoy.",

While it can be intense, the true essence of Indian food lies in the exquisite harmony of its diverse spices, resulting in a delightful and balanced medley of tastes. Dhamaka misunderstands that equation and the food is unapologetically fiery. But just that. We had the Potato Chaat, Afghani Chicken w/ Parathas, and the Nalli Biriyani. We topped the meal with Rabdi. The only saving grace were the parathas  crispy, buttery, and delightful! The Afghani Chicken was flavorful but a far-fetched interpretation of the OG dish.  At $70+ the Nalli Biriyani was all about the pageantry  massive sealed claypot, 8inch long shank, and the spectacle of wispy steam as the server removes the lid at the table! It was so fiery that none of the other flavors that are so typical of a well-made biriyani, came through. The lamb shank was such a great idea but the dish is very poorly executed. I really wanted to join the wagon and celebrate Dhamaka s near mythical reputation about the food they serve, but I came out very, very disappointed about it! Not going back!",

We made a reservation for May 27th 9 pm on April 28th, they call us the day of and requested to come in at 8:30pm which wasn t a big deal. We arrived, shortly after we order only to find out that they are out certain main dishes off their limited menu items we would like to order. Something as simple as Chaas was not available either. Upon expressing our concerns to our server (Sonam), stated  it is not my fault I am your server, would you like to order food or else I won t be able to serve you. Would you like to order food or do you want to keep discussing what we don t have?  Bad first time experience. If they are expecting certain number of people, I do not feel it is acceptable to talk to customers that way. Also the restaurant doesn t not accept large groups. We were party of 9 coming from Florida. We had emailed as soon as we made reservation which was a month ahead to request a table together and Rajasthani Khargosh (which is pre order only) but were told it is not possible. So already made compromise to sit at different tables only because the food is great. So upon arrival, we were not happy to find out what we want off the rest of the menu was not available either.",

                "review_text": "A place like Dhamaka will always get some polarizing opinions but let me start by saying that the April 2023 revamp has brought along some welcome changes. Firstly, and most importantly, the level of spice and oiliness has been brought down across the menu. In my visit, several items stood out: Aloo Dhamaka, Mirchi pakora, Bombay duck (actually a fish), lamb chaap, methi na gota all very tasty and even unique. I still think the paneer is possibly the best Ive had anywhere. The lamb shank biriyani is amazing and the quantity of meat is substantial. Theres a lot of flavor depth and multi-layeredness. Honestly, this paired with two appetizers could probably feed a group of 4. Lasooni lobster had great flavor but a bit too salty for my taste. The Nagaland pork - you really have to like pork belly to get into this one. My tablemates loved this dish but personally, it wasnt for me. The addition of the rolling Indian liquor cart (a la Junoon?) is a nice touch. Cocktails are as good as always. Great selection of beers too. Service was all around friendly & attentive.",

Had Aloo Dhamaka (girlfriends favorite among these), Lasooni Lobster (my fav, prepare for butter flavor intensity), Baingan Bharta (eggplant flavored by charcoal), paratha, and Saada Paan cocktail. Bartender was great about 1) explaining the new menu to us. 2) when I asked about the Chaas mocktail, he let me try a sample - - I disliked it, and appreciated the sample! 3) gave us an extra paratha when he said the first looked burnt. 4) staff offered sample tasters (eg the size of an ice cream parlor sample) of the desserts, which we appreciated. We heard a comment from one staff member (management?) who criticized the bartender for not pushing more cocktails on customers, which made us a little uncomfortable. As in 2021, spicy flavors were intense, but this time it didnt distract me in the way it had then. Unsure if the difference was my mental preparedness or the food. ___ Oct 2021 By group consensus, the winners of the night were the biryani and lasooni prawns. Almost every item was intensely spiced (not merely capsaicin spice), which had me mixed between loving it and distracted by the overwhelming intensities that stayed in my mouth. Service was attentive, and also fun with presentations/explanations for several of the items. Full list of items our group of 7 shared: Biryani Lasooni prawns Tabak maaz (lamb ribs) Rajasthani khargosh (Rabbit. When we initially try to reserve it 3.5 weeks in advance, we were told it was already sold out, so we rescheduled and reserved it 4.5 weeks in advance!) Gurda kapoora (goat kidney & testicles) Champaran meat Paplet fry (fish) Ajwani paneer tikka Biryani Lasooni Prawns Paratha Dal Basmati rice with ghee Chhena poda (cheese dessert) For drinks, theres a decent craft beer selection, and cocktails the group enjoyed such as the Gulaabo.",

                "review_text": "I would like to mention that I am vegetarian before you read my review. I visited Dhamaka today with my non-vegetarian friends. They really loved the food. Paneer tikka was really amazing. A must try. It was soft and delicious. Mirchi bajji was decent enough. Vegetable Pulav was really really disappointing. I felt the rice was not cooked properly and it was having little water the moment cooker was opened. I was actually thinking to order basmati rice and methi paneer but the waiter suggested the vegetable pulav saying   it will be phenomenal  . Please don t go with the waiter choice and ignore the vegetable pulav. Overall I felt so disappointing to spend my time and money here. To all the non-vegetarians, do visit this place for goat biryani(as suggested by my friends)",

Yes, the food is ridiculously spicy. As someone who grew up with chili peppers as a staple, I can tolerate the spiciness, but if you re not used to heat then order the milder items on the menu. Out of the several times I dined here, the biryani was the only disappointing dish. It s good, but there are so many better items on the menu that I regretted not getting something else. The dessert is unique, like a Basque burnt cheesecake but gooey and slightly savory. All that dairy helps get rid of the heat on your tongue before you leave the restaurant. I have a suspicion that the waitstaff are trained to make customers order more than needed. Portion sizes are huge. One pot / rice feeds 2-3 people with an appetizer to share.",

                "review_text": "I had such high expectations for Dhamaka! I have been following Chef Chintan Pandya s journey for a while now and am in such awe of what he has done for Indian food. However, my experience at Dhamaka fell short. We ordered the goat neck biryani, paneer methi, chapati and the bharela marcha. The bharela marcha was delicious - a fresh crunch from the raw pepper in contrast to the spicy, tangy filling with texture from peanuts - a delight! The biryani is hailed as one of Dhamaka s signature items. It was greasy and lacked depth of flavour. The paneer s texture was luscious and melted in your mouth but the gravy sat in a pool of ghee/oil and lacked the herbal notes you usually expect from methi. For all the hype, Dhamaka failed to deliver.",

Great portions, amazing dishes full of flavors, nice ambience with Hindi songs and the dishes if possible are presented in the vessel in which they are made. Strongest recommendations. The meal as a whole will be high fat and high salt (in the most enjoyable way) but it is something that will give you a meal to remember. We went all in on goat and it was a GOAT meal, we got the gurda kapoora (goat kidney and testicles), tabak maaz (lamb ribs) and the goat neck biryani. The flavors and meat both stood out and it was amazing nasally, orally and visually. The cheena poda (Orissas burnt cheesecake) was one of the best cheese cakes Ive ever had. The cocktails also look really good and selection is quite nice. Vegetarian options: They have some really good paneer options. Dietary restrictions: Would not recommend for vegans. Kid-friendliness: Paratha and chapati and some of the sides are have the few options kids have. Unless they can handle spice. Wheelchair accessibility: Yes",

We got all the top dishes that we were recommended. The lamb starters were the best i have ever had. The goat mech biryani was a bit dry and should have come with a raita. The meat was a bit too tough and not the best to chew. Champaran meat was excellent and juicey with straight spices. Overall great restaurant but 2 issues that exist. It is almost impossible to get a booking (but resy works well at times). The restaurant is pricey. We hit 350 usd for a meal for 4 (with only 2 cocktails). 100% recommend Vegetarian options: Got dal, roti which was nice",

The breads aren t made of wheat so definitely not authentic and are Americanised, daal tadka would have tasted better if they used ghee or better tadka, methi paneer had a lot of un-necessary oil used in its preparation and missed the right spices for a thick gravy dish (Paneer was super soft though and tasted fresh), and the menu lacked vegetarian options for a restaurant that talks about serving dishes that are not main stream.. we loved the food at Adda which is run by the same group so would love to come back if few things can change at Dhamaka.. hope this feedback brings some changes for good and helps everyone trying to get good Indian food and help unapologetic foods continue the great work they are trying to do..",

It is in the corner of Essex market so it s not a very intimate restaurant. It is fun and funky with the decorations, just different than I expected.",

They said wait time is 1 hr 45 mins and we diligently joined the wait list and came back on time. 1 hr 45 mins turned 3 hours as they made us wait at the bar. I even heard the staff murmur to each other  they won t give up , which I found too rude. Like if you couldn t accommodate, just ask us to go. We would happily go. But after 3 hours yu say sorry we can t seat yu, was a big turn off. And even while we waited at the bar, we got drinks and snacks, and were charged 20% gratuity, which was something they charge to people who get a table. It just was a bad evening and we saw them prioritize all the non desi ppl and made sure indians were kept waiting at the bar and eventually sent home (right when i was joining the waitlist, a lady was complaining about other guests getting priority. I should have got my clue there itself). You could see it on the staff s face how sadistic they were. I have never felt so insulted in this country ever.",

                "review_text": "Overall we felt the food was good: not mind-blowing, not bad. Were vegetarian and got the methi paneer (pretty good, but quite spicy), vegetarian biryani (pretty good, also has paneer), the fried eggplant app (was fine), the grilled paneer app (very tasty), the stuffed peppers app (very small and quite spicy), and the chaat app (quite good, somewhat spicy). I grew up eating South Asian food but consider myself to have relatively low spice tolerance; the food here was not as spicy as I was expecting after reading the reviews, but it was still a bit too spicy to be comfortable. The passionfruit mango lassi and the parathas definitely helped to assuage my mouth. The service was polite and nice. I would eat here again if they would manage the spiciness levels. Our server proactively told us that the entrees are made from scratch, yet when we asked if they could make the spiciness mild, he said the chef wont do that because he wants to stay true to his vision for the food. Perhaps once the hype around this place simmers down, they will be a bit more flexible on this. Vegetarian options: Relatively few vegetarian options :( There were 2 vegetarian entrees and 5 vegetarian appetizers. We tried 6 out of these 7 options and they were decent but would have liked more selection.",

Sigdiwala Chicken one of the worst chicken i ever had in my life , it s super hard, chewy with no taste. -2/5 5. Lasooni Prawn it was ok ok 3/5 In main course we tried 2 items 1. Goat Neck Biriyani another disappointment for us . The meat was tender no complain with that but we didn t find any flavor in biriyani. 2/5 2. Champaran Meat this is another star item on their menu , it s full with flavors, spicy , rich and tender juicy meat. Our server was good , very polite and gentle. Happening environment bit busy. We will be back for sure but definitely they have to work on their some items.",

Minus one star because the signature Rabbit Feast was underwhelming. We had high expectations for the 36 hour cooked, whole rabbit feast of which only one is prepared per day but definitely prefer the other items on the menu to the Rabbit.   However the sides and accompaniments were great (potato curry, Dahl, paratha, etc). But will definitely strongly recommend and return to the restaurant (and try Chef s other spots) .just won t order the rabbit again.",

Its unapologetic and elevated if you like shocking your tastebuds into submission (or clearing your sinus) with Instagrammable but overly spiced fatty meats on bone floating in 2 inches of oil and ghee. Im from South East Asia; I have a good spice tolerance and like a challenge. I bring along my own birds eye chillies to Thai and Vietnamese joints.  Even for me, the masala and aromatics like cardamoms were overdone on every dish at Dhamaka. I appreciate bold flavors in general but there is a point of diminishing return when you dont know what youre tasting because you are getting slapped by everything everywhere all at once. Pretty far off from any semblance of home cooking or comfort food. If you like getting on the hype train or getting hit in the face for fun, or appreciate a good gimmick like Dominique Ansels cronuts this is the place for you.",

I know that Indian food can be spicy (that s what s lovely about it, I adore spicy food) but it made for an unexciting palate. I had really been looking forward to this meal but the lack of diverse/new flavors and innovative dishes left me disappointed. Servers should warn patrons that all of the food being ordered is spicy including, inexplicably, the chicken pulao and the daal, which had a huge amount of chilis ceremonial dumped in it and then spread around so you couldn t even eat less spicy parts. Additionally, the grilled items all had the same sauce on them, which should have been made clear when ordering. The space is fine although difficult for hearing. Overall, I wasn t very impressed with service or the food, which I had heard would be exceptional and ended up being less tasty than somewhere like Indian Accent because the palate was so uniform.",

We got a feeling of this is what we serve, take it or leave it. Among other things we ordered Champaran goat meat and goat neck Briyani. It had warning of hot so we wanted that to be mild. The answer was sorry we can t do that. That was a downer. Food was very oily. Menu had very little choice for vegetarians. There was just one dessert. Overall not a very pleasant experience. May be Dhamaka only serves dishes from a very specific part of India. If you can t tolerate very hot spices be careful about what you order.",

Food was overly spiced / flavored like a chaat house - rather than a proper dinner place. Dont get me wrong, I love chaat. But, thats not how you flavor food for delicious dinner. Cocktails were not bad at all - pan flavored one was unique and worth a try. So was the panjabi whiskey one. Also, its totally missing an ambience. And, at this price point, thats really bizarre. Overall, the hype is not worth the food or the vibe and definitely not worth the price ($$$$). At the current price point, def not worth returning to. Vegetarian options: Lots of vegetarians in our party. We were fine. Kid-friendliness: Had one very solid kid option on the menu, but its not a kid-oriented place re: dinner.",

We had two appetizers, two entrees and a side order of the chapatis and a 1947 beer which came out to a total of $180 including a 20% gratuity. The pros: Both appetizers were ample and enough for four people. We had the Ragda Pattice a potato patty, white pea, green chili   and the Ajwani Paneer Tikka a house-made paneer, garam masala which we had to stop eating to leave room for our main course. The entree portions were even more generous in size and we realized we ordered way too much food.  The Goat Neck Dum Biryani a braised goat neck, Basmati rice, saffron was delicious with the right amount of heat.  The Lamb Shank Nihari with black cardamom, fried onion, tomato come in a medium sized stainless steel pot and reminded me of my mother s cooking.  This dish was spicier that the goat. An order of chapatis was not enough to accompany this dish and a side of basmati rice would be ideal. Twenty minutes into the meal we realized we had ordered enough for four people.  Noted for next time. The waitstaff is attentive but not overbearing.  They promptly refilled the glasses of water whenever it was low - essential with the spice level of some of the dishes. Cons: it s loud!  Every seat inside and out was occupied on a cold November evening at 7 pm so the noise level was loud to begin with and adding the pounding soundtrack of bhangra and other Bollywood tracks didn t help. We had the unfortunate luck of being two seats away from a party of six which included one woman who was especially loud throughout the entire meal - at several points we thought she was in distress or about to start an altercation but no, just an extremely loud person unaware of the social mores of eating at a restaurant. Our seat was adjacent to the half wall leading to the lone restroom so we always had either the open door or a persona waiting in line in our peripheral vision.  Perhaps they can add a curtain or extend the wall to ensure that lucky diner in this seat has a better experience. The reservation process is still a pain (while democratic). We had to book about a month and a half ahead of time by waiting for midnight when the spots become open by hitting refresh on the browser and having a quick trigger finger. Summary: We will be back, order less food and/or bring friends to enjoy what Dhamka has to offer Vegetarian options: A few vegetarian options available.",

Im basing my review solely on the food though. The dishes were way way way way too salty. Fortunately the spices were pungent enough that I was able to discern flavors other than saltiness. Our group however was really looking for heat, not just spiciness, and we got none of that. Food (good to bad): Tabak Maaz - So fatty and tender. Easily my favorite. Goat Neck Biryani - Very generous with the meat. I ate so much of the rice because it was the only dish other than the paneer that wasnt too salty. Champaran Meat - Not amazing, but far better than the non-meat dishes. Mango Lassi - This was straight up mango puree. Lasooni Prawns - The seasoning overpowered the flavor of the prawns, to the point it really didnt matter what protein it was. Papdi Chaat - This yogurt-wafers combo had to be an acquired taste, and I hadnt acquired it yet. I couldnt see the pomegranate seeds as more than an inconvenience. Paplet fry - A lot of breading, very little fish. Ajwani Paneer Tikka - Bland like tofu, but with way more calories. Didnt make any sense in my calorie/enjoyment calculus. I risked sodium overload in freezing weather. For what?",

We ordered 2 main dishes and 4 snacks/grills, none of them is spicy at all. On a scale of 1-10,  the spiciness level is 0.5. Papdi chatt - interesting dish, liked it. Paplet fry - fried fish, mediocre Paneer Tikka - cheese, its ok Tabak maaz - grilled lamb ribs, the lamb was very tender, but toooooo salty. Champaran meet - lamb stew, one of the spiciest dish but not spicy at all and very salty. Goat neck biryani - dry and salty",

I enjoy spicy food, but when something is so spicy that you can t even taste the main ingredient of the dish .what s the point? The lamb shoulder was exactly that. All you could taste were the spices that were overwhelmingly powerful and drowning out the meat. It was not enjoyable. I would not go back.",

After waiting to get a table for about 3 months, finally we dined there tonight. Judging by the prices and how impossible to find a table, I naturally anticipated more from it. Honestly it was a disappointment. We ordered Beguni which is a fried eggplant with turmeric and kasundi and served with mustardy sauce. Honestly there was no taste to it except for mustard taste and heavy fried smell. Then we got Bharela Marcha sweet peppers, peanuts, fresh coriander. This dish was slightly more interesting with a nice spicy taste and texture (not mind blowing though). After this, we shared Paneer Methi cashew cream, fenugreek, cumin. I guess this was the best tasting of all but drenched in greasy oil. Each dish was very greasy and heavy after taste.  Aged  Basmati rice was like a joke. It was soooo blend didn t taste like anything. Raita was blend it all! Just some cucumbers and creme fraiche taste. Sorry but this was a disappointment. The cocktails and wine selection were by far bad. The only good thing was the service.",

The ambiance, music, and decor are all unique and awesome. The service was great and everyone was friendly and attentive. Our server was on point with service and suggestions. And now the food. Literally everything was good. We got 5 apps/smaller plates and 2 entrees. The stand outs where the Gooda Kapoora, Tabak Maaz, and Lasooni Prawns. Got the Papdi Chaat and Radga Patrice as well which were both amazing combinations of flavor (also both vegetarian options). For mains we got the Goat Neck Dum Biryani and Murgh Kofta which were both very good as well.  The food was more than enough for the 3 of us and ended up taking some home. Easily one of the best Indian restaurants Ive never been to and one of the best overall Ive been to in a bit. Highly recommend checking this place out.",

I didnt say a word because Id be looked at as though Im fetching for a discount or a free meal. Also,  Id feel embarrassed for having experienced such.  And whats the difference,  Id already finished my meal when I came across it.  Also, the meat kabab, perhaps a not so popular dish at this location,  was smelly a little old. Which made sense why the waiter was trying to direct to other dishes.  Thank you for trying waiter but I really wanted to try your kabab since its a dish that I travel outside of my borough once a month for at another location. I do know that food here is cooked daily and all the time but I do suspect that this dish doesnt suit well at this location as it tastes like a hollow, in texture, old meat loaf with fresh sauce and great spices combined.  Do you understand what Im saying? Its overpriced.  Dont mind paying for excellent overpriced food but unfortunately this dish wasnt worth it. Also, at this location chicken makhni is not offered.  Overpriced ricotta cheese cake dessert.  Will NOT revisit, not worth the wait, space and hype. Fyi, Its a one lavatory restaurant with extensive wait time",

I have spent a lot of time traveling across India include remote parts of North East India - all I can say that this restaurant is doing a disservice to the spectacular regional cuisines I discovered in my journeys.

Individually each dish was super flavorful and quite spicy like every other review has mentioned, but I felt like everything in combination lacked balance. All of the items on the menu are quite heavy and didnt have enough variety in flavor profiles for my taste. Also our server was kind of oblivious, we were seated quite close to another table and he kept bumping into my shoulder with his butt while serving them   even though he couldve just stood at the other corner of their table where there werent other guests in the way. It happened several times throughout our dinner and he never noticed my obvious discomfort All in all, enjoyable to try, but didnt quite live up to expectations.",

Knowing that Dhamaka is the latest venture started by Owner Roni Majumdar and Executive Chef Chintan Pandya after Rahi and Adda, me and my wife were pretty excited to try it out. High expectations seldom match the experience. We were so glad Dhamaka lived up to the expectations, and more. The menu items are limited, however there are no side actors here. Each and every menu item is a star in its own. My wife being a pure vegetarian, tried Beguni, Bharela Marcha, Paneer Methi, Chapati, Paratha and Kesari Anjeer. You cant go wrong with any. Although, special mention for Beguni and the Bharela Marcha, we had never tried it and regretted wasting our life till now. The Paneer Methi is directly served in the pan in which its cooked, its delicious. I tried the Paplet fry, Goat belly seekh served on little cylindrical grill, and Champaran meat which is basically the best mutton you will ever experience. The Chef told us that Champaran meat will be limited availability, served on first ordered first served basis, so ensure that you order it first if you are interested. Add all this wizardry to the great conversation with Roni and Chef Chintan, we had a wonderful wonderful time. Thanks Team Dhamaka",

For the price and reputation, I expect the food to be easy to eat - instead, most dishes are filled with inedible pieces that are difficult to sort through. Bones are everywhere, from the fried fish that must be fileted, to the chicken pulao with small bits of broken bones in addition to the huge chunks of unappetizing ginger. Cocktails were notably below average. The only real point of interest is the choice of gamey meats used in some of the dishes, but I dont think this warrants a trip or the effort it takes to get a reservation.",

PAPDI CHAAT was refreshing yet more on the too spicy end. MURGH KOFTA was heavy, buttery, and spicy. For me the whole meal is a bit too rich. There are not so many refreshments or citrus tastes to balance the dishes. The waiter rushed us for so many times even though there were still 30 mins til the next reservation   interesting  Indian dishes (unlike regular butter chicken), good dining vibe, mediocre service",

I have a super high spice tolerance, but even I toward the end was losing my ability or enjoy all the flavors after the buildup in spice. But my biggest complaint was I feel like my waiter hoodwinked me lol. I asked him how much food I should order as one person, and he told me three snacks/grill items and an entree. And then the entree would need either rice or bread with it. Needless to say, that was WAY too much. I finished one (1) dish and had to take the rest back to my hotel room, which wasn t ideal since I was leaving the next day and wouldn t have time to eat it all. So I just kind of feel like he deliberately upcharged me. I even at the end said,  It was way too much food!  When he asked how it was and he didn t respond at all lol. I also had a weirdly long wait between my apps and entree with no explanation, even though he had said the entree was on its way when it didn t actually arrive until 20-30 minutes later. So idk. Kind of feel like I got taken advantage of and at the same time forgotten about. Weird. Was looking forward to it since I heard this is one of the best new restaurants in the country.

The goat neck biryani is an absolutely show stopper, and definitely get yourself some lamb ribs too. The cocktail program could use some work, but they have some wonderful beers that pair perfectly with the fiery food. Also, try your luck walking in if you cant get a reservation! Its worked for me twice, and both were weekends.",

This is the worst indian food I had in my entire life, I wonder how the hype about this restaurant & chef got created. We ordered Paplet fry, Gurda Kapoora, Murgh kofta, Champaran Meat, Goat neck dum biryani, Dal Dhamaka, Paratha, Ghee Bhat, Brown Munde drink. 1. Paplet fry had zero taste, any random Indian restaurant can do better. 2. Gurda Kapoora had only oil and spices, extremely less meat and extremely salty. Extremely bad dish. 3. Champaran Meat was the worst goat I ever had, Not sure if they are using the leftover of others. It had literally no meat but all the fat and big garlic to cover all that. 4. Murgh Kofta - Extremely Salty, Horrible taste 5. Goat Neck Dum Biryani - Server told us it has 16 layers, Are you kidding me!!!  Please fool others but not the people who knows these dishes in and out. It was nothing but a boiled rice with meat. Again the worst Biryani ever. 6. Dal Dhamaka - Restaurant struggling to make a Dal raises all alarms, this is exactly that restaurant. Extremely Salty, Tasteless Dal. 7. Paratha - It was nothing but an uncooked flour paste and extremely Salty. 8. Ghee Bhat - Boiled rice with ghee 9. Brown Munde - $23 for this, very bad. We tried forcing ourselves to eat these dishes but we couldn t & had to leave the restaurant empty stomach. Either Chintan has no contribution in the restaurant  or he himself doesn t know the taste.",

Very disappointed as I was looking forward to trying this place more than any other on our trip to NYC after reading all the reviews on Eater, TimeOut (who went as far as saying best restaurant of the year) etc.  I live in London U.K. and this place can t hold a candle to the Indian restaurants there. Even the mediocre ones. The food is VERY spicy. I love spicy food, but the heat made this food inedible to the extent you thought you were participating in a spicy food challenge. We complained to the waiter and he just said yeah the chef likes his food spicy. The food was also extremely greasy. Very sorry to say, but I do not recommend this restaurant and would suggest avoiding.",

We had done good research in advance about the chef and the food but we were taken in for surprise when the food and drinks surpassed our expectations. I had  chulbul  and  paaji  while my husband had  brown munde . We wanted to try all the possible appetizers so we had papdi chaat, ragda pattice, bharela marcha and ajwani paneer tikka. My husband went gaga over the paneer as it melted in mouth. That tells they make fresh paneer everyday. All the flavors were crafted nicely. They make all their entrees from scratch for you only. We ordered methi paneer and murgh kofta and the waiter brought the whole wok in which they prepared them. We really enjoyed the flavors and the freshness of the food. Highly recommend it. Value for money, freshness and flavors all in one at Dhamaka!",

                "review_text": "I ve been to Dhamaka on three occasions now so I ll summarize my most recent visit, as well as others that I enjoyed during my previous visits. Not mentioned below (due to character limit) are the grilled paneer and the Ragda Pattice (both great). I ve had most of the grilled menu at this point and it s all delicious. Papdi chaat - A beautiful medley of yogurt, chili-cilantro hari chutney, tamarind, and chaat masala with a pop of pomegranate to mix things up a bit. And, of course, that signature dhamaka spice. Every bite is a flavor explosion. If you haven t had chaat before, I d recommend this dish over any other. My favorite and they do it perfectly! Gurda kapoora - Testicles and kidneys! And chilies! Spicccyyyyy. And buttery. All in a rich, fragrant, fiery tomato gravy. Not for the faint of heart and not for the average eater. But get past your reticence, soak all that up in some crispy and buttery pav (bread roll), and you have yourself a wonderful concoction reminiscent of your favorite hearty chili. If you re lucky enough to come on a night when this isn t sold out (seriously), I highly recommend adding this to your order. Paplet Fry - if you hadn t guessed yet, I m Indian. But My household did not do seafood outside of a tilapia fillet fry every so often. So when I get a chance to experience the way that my people do seafood, I m always appreciative of the experience. The seasoning on this dish is perfect granting a tangy and flavorful playfulness that bounces off the crispness of the fish wonderfully. Add to that some pickled red onions and cilantro-chili chutney if you must, I honestly felt it didn t need anything else. (Probably my Atlanta side telling me that I miss fried fish in the south). Goat Belly Seekh - I ve had plenty of seekh kabobs but this one is truly unique. Their means of grilling this spicy concoction? Wrapping it in wood to create a convection oven effect and letting it soak in the juices that would otherwise fall out if baked in such a manner. Genius. We also had a brief conversation with Chef Pandya before our dinner, who recommended this as his favorite item. So we ordered 3. Fresh roti! They asked so I will never turn it down. Not the best roti I ever had but happy to have it all the same. Lamb Shank Nihari - Y all. So many amazing plates during this visit, and so many things that I d absolutely get again, but this was tonight s standout. I make a damn good nihari at home, so my standards are high, and of course, I m always looking to compare. There are components that you need to get correct in order to do this dish right I ve never had lamb in a nihari so I was curious how the changeup would sit with me. It sat just fine. Right off the bat (bone), the lamb melted into the gravy. Meat, check. Thickness and consistency, check. Spice, check check check (Chef Pandya never disappoints in spice). And it all comes together beautifully. You can have nihari at home 2/3x a week and still come here and feel like you re getting something different. But something that really holds true to the essence of what a nihari should be. A+ dish. Goat Neck Dum Biryani. We had some Hyderabadis in our party so we tend to be particular when it comes to a good biryani. Personally, I felt it held up, but it didn t wow me. But others in our party loved it, and one even said it s as good as any Hyderabadi biryani that he s had. One unique component: there is a layer of spice (because of course there is) on the dum lid. I recommend using this as your carb-vessel with all other dishes. You re welcome. Champaran meat - this was a new dish for me, I d never heard of it or tried it. If you love garlic (let s be honest, who doesn t), this is the dish for you. A full head of garlic was the first thing I caught in my roti -  didn t realize that until my second bite but I wasn t at all mad about it. The meat is tender and altogether this is a tasty dish, recommended by Chef Pandya as well. My thoughts? Too many things I love on this menu, and too many things I ve yet to try for me to come back to this one.",

We waited for 90 mins and still weren t offered a table even though we were told were  up next . We had a senior citizen and 3 toddlers in our group and yet we received no compassion or respect from the host. The manager was the saving grace. Wonderful lady with a great demeanor who mentioned that it takes months to make a reservation-it would have been helpful if she would ve told us that when we first arrived and we re promised a table shortly. The server also took the liberty of making personal comments on items of the menu even though we clarified multiple times that we re vegetarian and have limited food choices. He also made several attempts to dissuade us from ordering the dessert. The cruelty of the host and the waiter completely overshadowed our dining experience.

They went so well together and the buttery daal was probably the best daal Ive ever had (Ive had a lot of daal in my life). 5) the chicken pulao, I thought it was good but definitely gonna try the goat biryani next time, my wife though really liked it.",

The food was good. It tasted good and was good quantity wise too. Once we were done a friend went to the restroom so we were waiting for him and then the staff comes up to us and tells that we will have to vacant the table.

We took the look around and decided to come back up to Dhamaka to eat. We asked to put our name on the wait list and went back downstairs to have a drink until our table was ready. Our table was now ready, and my boyfriend went up to retrieve our table while I closed out the bill at the bar downstairs. He then called me because he said he was not allowed to sit until I was present. Now mind you, the host saw he and I together twice. So why could he not get sat? Even if policy is that all guest must be present to sit down, to me a table for a party of 2 is the same size as if 1 person came in to dine. Now if we said 4 people and they only saw 2, the policy makes sense, but that was not the case. We were seated and the woman who sat us proceeded to say we only have an hour and fifteen minutes because we were walk-ins. Cool, no problem. Now our server comes and repeats the same thing the woman said who sat us. I was a bit irritated at this point because I felt rushed. He back within less than 2 minutes and asked if we ready. Mind you it s our first time there, so no, I am not ready and asks him  Can we have a minute . He comes back, I have questions about the menu, and he answers them and now everything seems to fine. He said the food would take about 30 minutes to come out because its fresh and it actually came out sooner, so my boyfriend and I were happy. We finished our delicious meal, paid for it, and went to the bathroom before we left the premises. My boyfriend is looking for the bathroom and the bartender chimes in and says  Can I help you . My boyfriend replies  we just ate here and are looking for the bathroom . He then says  you have to go downstairs  Mind you we had just finished our meal at the establishment. At this point I am even more irritated because how dare this man not listen to my boyfriend when he specifically said we just ate here and are looking for the bathroom. One of the hosts then makes eye contact with the bartender as if it is okay for us to proceed. That honestly made me upset because he didn t even ask questions and wanted to send us somewhere else far from the bathroom that was in close proximity to where we were standing. I m not sure if I will ever dine back at this establishment because of the service but I will say the food did make me happy. That service has got to be better.",

The amount of heat and spices used in most of the dishes is insane. That is not the Indian food we grew up eating. I have had better lamb ribs.The biryani was trash. Please please don t think that this is what Indian biryani tastes like, it doesn t. The flavor, aroma and the taste was lacking. The paan bahaar  cocktail had less paan and more alcohol. Save your money time and energy. DONT GO  THIS IS NOT A PAID REVIEW",

All the dishes were flavorful and delicious - but among my favorites was the minced goat belly kebab. Be warned though - the menu does lean heavily towards mutton and goat - so if you re not a fan, perhaps not a place for you. Also the dishes can be spicy, which I love. If you re not sure if you handle the spice level here, go nearby for lunch to their Rowdy Rooster chicken sandwich place and order the medium spicy - that ll tell you.",

We tried two snacks (fish and brinjal dishes) and both tasted similar. The grilled chicken also had similar spices but a notch higher. Dessert (only one option) was good and much needed to cool off the spices. We don t mind giving the restaurant one more shot to try some other dishes but only if a reservation is easily available online like other normal restaurants. Otherwise not wasting hours on this place which is more hype than anything else .plenty of better options in NYC.",

Yes, the food is spicy - but Im a wimp when it comes to heat and I handled it just fine with the servers guidance. We had Papdi Chaat, Ajwani Paneer Tikkia, Goat Neck Biryani (the only Biryani I have ever had outside of India that gets it right!), and the delightful dessert as well as several cocktails. I just want to give this place a great big hug and thank it (and its chefs) for existing. Well be back!",

An excellent Indian restaurant where every single dish has the right spices and rich flavor. We didnt have a reservation and we were told it was an hour and half for the next open table however that didn t happen, this restaurant had no cancelations and it was a very busy afternoon. We were able to order some appetizers and cocktails from the bar. One of the things that I would like to mention is the great customer service from the hostess, the bartenders and the waiters everyone was very accommodating, friendly and attentive. Kudos to William and Raj who recommended dishes and to our bartender that offered us some mango juice to calm the spiciness from the tiger prawn We ordered Fried Fish, Goat Belly Seekh, Tiger Prawns, Tabak Maaz. Every single dish was phenomenal. The fish  tasted fresh, and the ribs were tender, juicy and tasty. Special commendation on the tiger prawn, it was spicy but the flavor was super delicious. An overall mind blowing experience! MAKE A reservation and try it yourself ;) Ps The cocktails were also great. My favorite Paan-E-Dhaar",

To be honest, aside from some curious dishes in the menu, the place doesn t deserve such high rating. 1) ambiance extremely noisy like a disco bar. The outdoor part is ugly, too improvised, and definitely not worth the price. The indoor is ok. 2) food: we took mutton (very spicy) and Gurda Kapoora. The portions are small. 3) drinks: if this restaurant is to be in the best 50 of New York again who wrote the recommendation on behalf of Time Out is not a competent person. We ordered a beer (a Belgian one) and it was in a can not in a bottle. You can serve a can beer in a convenience store or gas station not in a restaurant.

                "review_text": "To note: this review is specifically for the Rajasthani Khargosh (rabbit dish). I ve been trying for some time to get the ever elusive rabbit dish so I was so excited to finally reserve it a month before my reservation for a prime weekend time. It made it hard to wait for that long but it surely didn t disappoint. This dish is truly a one of kind experience. Yes, not just a meal, but an entire experience. Our waitress (Lila) and the story she told about the dish and the restaurant really took this to another level. The restaurant is labeled as unapologetic Indian, which is a great way to describe how this dish came to be. You can read all about the backstory elsewhere, but it makes it feel special to understand everything that goes into this. The rabbit itself is spectacular, cooked in a sealed pot after making a trip from upstate New York days earlier and then marinating for some time. It s so tender and just goes perfectly with whatever sauce it s cooked in. It s spicy for sure - you know that going in and you start to notice that immediately. The rabbit itself is served whole, head, organs, and everything else. For those of you who are adventurous like me, I highly recommend try every piece of this animal. It s part of what makes it so special, given that most foods we eat aren t prepared whole like this (besides fish). On the side, they provide some bread to dip into any of the array of options, which included an incredible lentil dish and a spicy potato side. Those lentils were maybe the best I ve had and complement the other dishes well (mostly because they provide some relief from the spice). Don t worry, they also give you a bit of yogurt and rice in case the lentils aren t enough to cool your mouth. Lila (waitress) really made this meal additionally special so I definitely want to make sure she gets the shoutout. Not only was she very attentive, but she was clearly enjoying our experience and entertained our questions, curiosity, and general wackiness of three 20-somethings out at dinner. I m really glad that a place like this exists to push the boundaries on cuisine by introducing truly unique dishes. I really enjoyed their other restaurant Adda (Long Island City) when I went a few years ago and consistently enjoy (read: love) my constant trips to Angel (Jackson Heights), which is helmed by a former Adda chef. The Indian food in NYC is really special because of places like these.",

                "review_text": "It seems that they ve done a solid job of PR because I find it hard to reconcile reviews from food critics with my real life experience. Food falls flat on flavor whilst still being a slap in your face with heat. My hunch is that many of the reviewers are mistaking heat for flavor. Heads up: The menu is limited for vegetarians and appetizers are better than mains. We got papdi chat and ragda pattice for apps. Ragda pattice was excellent and papdi chat was good but not true to the Punjabi style papdi chat. Anyhow, whatever it was, it was good. For mains, we got the paneer methi dish with paratha. The paratha again wasn t authentically Punjabi and had a processed/pre-made taste. The paneer was incredibly fresh but the methi leaves needed to be cooked more. The gravy was heavy on cinnamon (found a 5 inch cinnamon bark) and had an unpleasant bitter taste from the uncooked methi. The flavor profile absolutely needs more balancing and the recipe needs more cooking time. Cocktails are great! Overall, over-priced for what it is given that the restaurant is just an area sectioned off in a food hall. Meat eaters will likely have a better experience with food here. Lots of choices. I ve tried Adda, Dhamaka and Rowdy Rooster and it seems that unapologetic foods does street eats and chaat well but not mains and curries. I find them over-hyped for this reason. They re not consistently good across the board. Their menu is a hit or miss depending on what you order.",

Not only was the food fresh, flavorful and in huge portions, the service was a standout feature. The staff noticed a slight wobble to our table even before we noticed it, and immediately came to add small foam wedges under the legs to stabilize it. I noticed them doing the same to another table next to us and was amazed - this isnt the first time Ive had a wobbly table at a restaurant but it was the first time that I saw staff notice and correct it. Our food and drinks all came out very fast and with perfect timing. If you dont like spicy food this isnt the place for you, our dishes were HOT, but in a good way. Definitely recommend the Mango Passion Lassi to complement the heat, and the tiny cheesecake dessert was simple but hit the spot.",

This is apparently the hardest place to get a reservation and it s pretty popular but I don t get why. If you re looking for GOOD desi, go to Bhatti or even GupShup for the ambiance. This unfortunately was not it   especially for the high price point. star for an awesome music choice :)",

The food is mind blowing (I use that word sparingly) and the flavors were an explosion! We ordered the following and highly recommend these dishes: 1. Papdi chaat - explosion of flavor 2. Ragda pattice - my all-time favorite chaat! 3. Ajwani paneer tikka - this paneer is marinated and roasted and is the sole reason why I would come back numerous times over, it literally melts in your mouth! 4. Veggie pulao & goat neck dum biryani - my friends and husband enjoyed this dish 5. Paratha Absolutely loved our dining experience here - it was a bit pricey, but literally worth the value. Our server was very kind and friendly! Cocktails were the cherry on top. Will definitely come back for more :)",

Restaurant inside Essex Market with a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating. Menu leans heavily lamb and goat but there are some vegan and veg options. Cocktails were all complex and scrumptious. The mezcal drinks were incredibly smoky. For 3 people, we ordered: Ajwani Paneer Tikka - absolutely amazing. Soft, freshly made paneer grilled crispy on the sides served with mint chutney and pickled onions. I ve never had fresh paneer before and our party wanted to order another!! Mild in flavor profiles compared to the other dishes we ordered. Ragda Pattice - a crispy potato patty served in a gravy loaded with crispy bits, peas, and serious chunks of green chilis. Delicious. Really spicy. I would also order this over and over again. Murgh Kofta - a chicken mince scotch egg bathing in curried gravy. Pretty spicy. Our server recommended we order a side of pao to eat with the gravy and it was a very good suggestion Goat Biriyani - smelled amazing. Tasted amazing. Goat neck meat was very tender. Though delicious, it was my least favorite of all the dishes we ordered. Pao - soft bread toasted in butter I would eat on their own",

To our surprise, the restaurant was a section inside the Essex market food court so zero points for the ambiance. We ordered Paneer ( it was super dry and hard), Papri Chat (too soggy), Pomfret fish (full of bones that I almost choked) and Goat Biryani (suicidal level spicy and oily). I literally had a dhamaka (translates to Blast) in my stomach after eating such spicy and bad quality food. When we complained to the server about the spice level, he very rudely replied that we are unapologetically Indian so cant do anything about it.  Sorry but Dhamaka has to work on not just food but also teach some basic service etiquette to their staff. Overall, Dhamaka is All Pomp and No Show. You will find much better Indian restaurants in the city to satiate your taste buds. Google - Can we get a 0.5 star for Dhamaka? Thankyou!!",

I am a half Bengali and half Khasi, so I ordered Beguni, a popular snack in Kolkata and Doh Khleh which is quite a popular dish in Meghalaya, I found both really disappointing and not authentic at all. The begunis were really bad if I must say. NO ONE in India makes those two dishes that way, at all. It was not unapologetically Indian. The Lasooni Prawns were good. We ordered Ghee Bhat and Dal Dhamaka, the Dal was pretty average. We then ordered the Goat Neck Dum Biryani, which was the second tasty thing we ate at this place. Once I found out that one of the owners was a Bengali himself, I was shocked that he let those begunis even reach our table. I would never do that to a fellow Bengali. I think the dishes all have a North Indian style of cooking, which they tried to create with the Doh Khleh, which was actually upsetting. I mean just because its Indian, doesnt mean you have to lather everything with spices even when the dish doesnt require it. Over all, I left the place heartbroken which is my fault because of my high expectations from the words unapologetically Indian.",

We ordered Ragda Patties, tandoori trout, mutton curry and goat biryani. Each dish was a dhamaka (explosion) in the mouth, but NOT in a good way. Food was either too spicy or too salted. Ragda Patties and trout were soooo spicy, that my husband and I (who grew up eating spicy food) had our noses running! We saw people at other tables struggle too. The mutton, on the other hand, was over salted. The biryani was the only thing that was edible and enjoyable. The cocktails were average too. We have had much better modern Indian food in NYC. I would urge the chef to tone down the  explosion.  I like that Dhamaka is unapologetically Indian, but please don t make it unbearably Indian!",

There is zero consideration for locals over trying to be some hot spot. The food was good at first, but most recently not very good (way too salty, poor balance of favors) and overpriced. Most restaurants with no love for locals do not make it. I give it another year or two before it s gone :(",

We weren t really feelin alcohol so we started with the mango/passion fruit lassi and the papaya juice  both were delicious! Then we got the house made paneer  i normally don t love paneer but it was amazing, i would eat 5 of them on my own. For our mains, we got the goat neck biryani (huge portion, lots of flavor, very spicy, and delicious meat) and the gurda kapoora  my boyfriend was not down to eat testicles but the waiter sold him on it so we ordered it. it wasn t weird at all, the kidney and testicles are chopped up so it s just meat in a delicious spicy sauce that you eat with this soft delicious toasted roll and we loved it. We sat outside and there was a chilly breeze coming through the bottom of the tarp thing, we were freezing even though we were next to a heater. I would recommend getting a table indoors if you can. Overall, I absolutely recommend trying this place! Not sure if it lives up to being  the best indian restaurant in nyc  but it s delicious and unique for sure.",

I paid almost $200 for a meal for a 2 people and left hungry. Everything is extremely oily and spicy and I was told that there was no way I could indicate my food s spicy level because the kitchen is too  unapologetically Indian . Trust me, I love my food spicy, but my stomach is hurting from so much spicy! The portions were also VERY small. Stick to your local Indian spot. I m very disappointed, hungry and sad for the $200 I ve wasted for nothing. The only reason I m giving it 2 stars is because the lassi was good.",

We did not have a Resy and we patiently waited 2 hours for our table. (We walked around essex market, grabbed cocktails) By the time we got our table we are excited, hungry af and have high expectations for food because of the beautiful reviews. Since we are starving af we ordered quite a a lot of stuff! Paplet Fry (fried fish) $18 Gurda Kapoora goat kidney & testicles $16 Tabaak Maaz $16 Goat Neck Dum Biryani $39 Dishes was executed well, cooked to perfection. Lamb ribs was fall off the bone, the fish was perfectly fried, mutton was nicely braised. But almost all food has this spiced powder blend that they have. It was great at first bite but EVERY dish have the same spiced flavor profile. It was quite redundant. But the big issue here is everything was WAY TOO SPICY! Take note, me and my partner are both Asian and love spicy food. We also live in Jackson Heights (Queens, NY) which have a great Indian Food scene so we are really familiar with Indian food. But we werent really able to tolerate the spice level of every dish in this restaurant. For the price we pay we are really really disappointed. We werent able to finish any dish. WE LEFT STARVING AF. On a good note: Cocktails were phenomenal. We tried the Gulaboo, which was quite refreshing, slightly sweet with a hint of rosewater. Sadaak Chap tasted like a classic old fashioned. Service was great! Tina (hostess) was very accommodating! And our server really took care of us.",

Same goes for the dal - was too hot to enjoy, dunno why you would make a dal so spicy with some red Chilli spice. Menu is limited so makes it easier to order. Portion size was much smaller than expected for some dishes (See the 3 small peppers in pic). For all the hype, I found this to be a bit underwhelming. All the dishes had a similar tasting masala sprinkled on it which made it really hot *the kind where that spiciness lingers in your throat for long and you want to eat an ice cream    Love the innovation though. Might come back to try the dessert.",

The food experience was amazing. We ordered a total of 4 dishes and 1 dessert. Our waitress was so nice and gave us great recommendations. Must order: 1. Goat neck briyani - I ve tried Briyanis from NYC and I think Dhamakas BRIYANI is number 1. It s spicy and very flavorful. The yogurt that comes on the side definitely helped. 2. Paap Di Chaat - a great appetizer that is sweet and sour with a nice crunch to it 3. Dessert - the cheesecake like texture is out of this world. The aroma of the dish was so earthy. Never had a dessert like this before. We re definitely going to come back and try more dishes. I talked to a friend and she said that the cooking style here is like Indian home cooked meal / street food and is very similar to what she has back home in India. Definitely give this spot a try!",

But is it worth the hype? I m really not sure. I was happy to see some of the items on the menu that are very regional Indian cuisine and not so common for other Indian restaurants but honestly the taste was far from authentic. The pomfret fry was my favorite. Also, I found the ambiance to be a bit confused and I still don t understand why an Indian restaurant that is trying to be different must still feel the need to play blaring mainstream Bollywood music that makes it so difficult to have a decent conversation, also when there are so many diverse genre of Indian music to choose from. Overall my experience at Dhamaka was just ok, there s a lot of room for improvement, however kudos to the team for trying.",

The Champaran Meat paired with Chapati/Ghee Bhat almost made me cry! The cocktails are all very great, but I particularly recommend the one with the Paan (betel leaf). Try anything with Paneer  they make it from scratch, and the chances are that s the best paneer you ll ever have! I loved the staff  they are very enthusiastic and professional.

However, the items that stand out are well worth the cost in quality: my personal favorite was the lamb appetizer and the biriyani. Its worthwhile sampling a few different things as a result, especially if you have a larger party. Its also worth mentioning theres not a ton of vegetarian options as the entire menu is pretty small.",

Its the most authentic Indian food Ive had in NYC and it was delicious! The service was super friendly and what I would expect for a super busy restaurant. The only complaint I agree with is that there isnt a huge number number of vegetarian options. The options they had though were delicious and the limited selection pretty standard for a restaurant in the United States. Side Note: to the moron who was worried they were serving an endangered species, shark, is a subclass of fish. There are literally 1,000 species. Not all of them are endangered and some are raised for food like salmon, tuna and other fish that are considered at risk.",

Quite steep I say. After a doctors appointment we managed to show up on time, because it was a friendly team who had opened another restaurant in the city! We were seated within 15 minutes by an extremely helpful and attentive team. It was 4 adults and our 2 year old who was seated in his very comfortable high chair. What we liked: the appetizers, cocktails, and service was very nice. Very flavorful, packed with taste and punch! Most cocktails cost $18 and Paan-E-Bahar + City Harvest was a winner. If you like the flavor of Paan, this drink is packed with that taste! Appetizers are priced well, Bharela Marcha (3 pcs) ($9) and Ajwani Paneer Tikka - 2 pieces ($13) were absolutely delicious. The Paneer was very fresh and definitely felt like homemade! What we did not like: Pricing! I understand its Delancey street, but its definitely not that expensive to rent a shared space. Food is good, but some of the entrees are a little too expensive. $29 for a veggie pulao is a bit much, no matter how much you jazz it up with a super star chef level with some super flavored mix is masalas. Served in a nice mini pressure cooker the dish looks very inviting and is tasty. Goat Neck Dum Biryani at $39 comes in a relatively large portion which was shared by 3 people. I wish the portion size is reduced and the price, so we couldve tried a few other mains which we couldnt. One thing that definitely stands out is they dont ask for desired spice level, and the spice level is absolutely perfect (slightly on the spicier side). We absolutely loved the food, so Chintan - well done again! There was also one point in time in the evening where the music was very loud for us to have conversations. Fortunately they realized it and reduced the volume eventually. Service was top notch and the staff is very friendly here. We might visit again!",

Most of their dishes are mutton based but some options in paneer and chicken too. From appetizers to main course everything was more delicious than other dish competeting for the best dish from gheir menu. One thing that definitely stands out is the Champaran meat, its a must have and do not forget to ask for it one day prior by calling in. Overall a very aesthetic restaurant, coupled with superlicious taste and food presentation. Its bit on the costlier side compared to competetitors but every penny spent is worth it.",

The food is delicious and unique; sensations of fire and ice that never overcome the most important feature of great cuisine - flavor. Lastly, if you want a real treat begin your dining experience at the little bar. We enjoyed lovely drinks and delightful conversation with a very creative bartender.",

We felt some indicators on the menu to warn people what is very hot would help a lot.  We had to send it back  I will say, then the server and manager were very accommodating and helpful. We also had the Eggplant (good), Dal (good) and Lamb chop appetizers (good flavor, however if you prefer truly lean meat, best to order something else).  Otherwise the menu is quite full of  chef s cuts  for the more adventurous eater.  (I was shocked to see  baby shark  on the menu, am I understanding correctly an endangered species is featured?)",

The rabbit comes with a side dish of potato, dal and Paratha. We ordered a couple of other dishes like the mutton and the shark curry. Everything was just amazing. Having spent over 25years in India, I can vouch -- this is as authentic and good as it gets",

Indian food in the US is very toned down with cashew and cream rich curries, but not here and not in India.  Loved the Pomfret fry, very yummy, the spice was just right, the coating couldve been lighter, but tasted great. We had the Champaran goat, the goat neck biriyani and pressure cooker chicken biriyani. All of them were flavor packed and delicious. The meat was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender. Best goat Ive had in the US. Highly recommend Dhamaka to anybody who wants to try authentic North and West Indian food. The goat biriyani is Lucknowi and the chicken is closer to a Maharashtrian Alani Bath per my Maharashtrian fiance ! Definite must go !",

Definitely get the eggplant Beguni appetizer. Wow ! That was so surprising with hot mustard ! Really good. My friend got grilled lamb ribs and liked that . The prawn grill only came with one and although it was tasty Id try the peanut and pepper grill next time. The paneer methi main course is big ! And delicious. Recommended. I took some home with me. Rice doesnt come with the mains so order some on the side. My friend got the baby shark and this was also surprisingly good, different and had a lot of meat in it. As far as bread , I thought the Chapati was better than the paratha but I wish the Chapati was bigger ( wish they had naan actually! ) The drinks arent too big but they were also flavorful and unique. My friend got two of the NRI which is a tasty coconut milk and scotch and Cointreau drink, tasty. I got the betel leaf and gin and ginger liqueur Paan e Bahar drink and that was nice and definitely different. I also got the mezcal and passion fruit Joshila drink and even for someone who doesnt like mezcal it was good because the fruit cuts a lot of the smokiness. They only had one dessert available so we skip that one and went inside the Essex Market instead. Downstairs in the Essex Market is Ample Hills ice cream which I think is open til 9pm.Get the Oatmeal lace flavor,that was like a snicker doodle cookie, nice",

The Sadak Chhap is a very interesting drink that we loved at first, but make sure to drink it quickly before the flavors separate. They have tons of GF options, which was a lovely surprise. The Ragda Pattice is tasty, although too much cilantro for this cilantro tastes like soap gal. Beguni was melt in uh our mouth, although I didnt like the mustard sauce that came with it. The Paplet Fry was my favorite once we learned how to eat it. Be warned, there are a ton of bones, but its still worth it! And my husband devoured the Gurda Kapoora. I tried a bite and the flavors were incredible. And you should definitely get the made-to-order Chena Poda. We cant wait to make a res and experience the full menu. What an incredible addition!",

Went here just as NYC was reopening in April and was sooooooooper happy with the service and shout out the owner for being a gentleman and scholar making this an experience to remember. Found this place courtesy of eater nyc. They were right to put it on their new hotness list. We started with the Ragda Pattice (crispy potato) which was delicious, crispy, well seasoned and the perfect spice level.  We then had Bharela Marcha (stuffed sweet peppers) which was the most surprising and best vegetarian bite of the night.   The best carnivore bite of the night was the Tabak Maaz (lamb ribs).  I love ribs and these are in my top 3 ribs in the world. For the mains I had the original scotch egg (Murgh Kofta, yet another thing my British fore-bearers stole from India).  It was amazeballz.  My wife had vegetarian biryani which was cooked in a pressure cooker and had crispy delicious rice on the bottom.  Dont share the bottom with anyone, you will want it all. 13/10 will go back from ribs, stuffed pepper & biryani.",

Goat neck biryani, the meat was tasty but I dunno what was with the seasoning but we all thought it was overly salty that we got extra plain  rice to mix in to see if it would salvage the dish but no it didnt.... Maybe it was an off day? We all felt full but realized it was due to the amount of water we drank to eat the salty biryani..",

Thats their selling point, and boy do they deliver! We started with the Beguni- crispy fried eggplant, then moved on to the Tabak Maaz(and this is a must). The ribs were delectable, soft and juicy paired perfectly with the pickled onions. Next and I would say the most traditionally made, was the succulent Champaran Meat(with a whole baked garlic) and we paired it perfectly with the Parathas, which was so flaky and crispy and oozing with ghee. Also special mention was the Chena poda dessert, which is marriage between a age old Odissa delicacy with the basque burnt cheesecake. Overall, its a must try guys. Do make a reservation as it was house full even on a regular Wednesday.",

From authentic true to its roots dishes, to brave fusions that stretch the rich culinary heritage of India while taking creative leaps. When we looked at the menu at Dhamaka it had the makings of a promising hip Indian restaurant that seemed to balance both. The reality was sadly far from it. We ordered plenty of food. With each dish being regrettably worse than the other. The fish and the lamb chops are just doused in spice mix that makes you wonder if it was the spice mix that was main dish being served with protein as an accompaniment. The oil in the biryani left a horrible after taste. The kind that sticks to roof of your mouth and leaves you feeling gassy later. The chicken can only be taken down with the chutney and pickled onion they give on the side. The chicken kofta is overpowered by the mustard in the curry and might I tell you feels terribly undone to begin with. The masala in kofta seemed to be uncooked - could have spent some time being sauteed to remove the raw taste of what I m sure is the same spice mix. If you take a closer look at the photos on Google Maps or the dishes in person the overpowering use of this spice mix will seem evident. Every dish either garnished by it or cooked with it. Which is probably why all their dishes seem to lack any kind of structure and depth. Like a young grad who left home from India to study in the US, recreating the flavors of home, with the overbearing use of this spice mix. There is one stand out dish that deserves five whole stars on its own. This is the only dessert the restaurant serves -  Chenna Poda  from the humble lands of Nayagarh, Odisha in India. Everything about this dish makes me yearn for what this restaurant could have been. Everything about this dessert is the promise and potential this restaurant has but is clearly too self occupied pretending to be something it cannot to notice. The simplicity of the dish, the humility of the clay bowls and banana leaf it s served in, and the regal taste for what very much is a village treat. Alas, the only dish I d come back to this restaurant for. Everything else is a hard pass.",

I havent been so excited about a restaurant since the first tiny Mission Chinese opened on Orchard St. Everything we had was delicious, boldly spiced but not painfully hot, perfectly cooked, and unique enough to stand out on the table. The potato patty was one of our favorites, with a fruity mango(?) based sauce that deftly balanced heat and sweet. The goat belly from the grills was also outstanding - like a loosely packed sausage studded with bright herbs and a perfect amount of fat. But the best was the fried fish loaded with cumin and crunchy as could be, with addictive picked red onion on the side. The unctuous lamb ribs and the pig face with its smoky char were also great. I love how brave they are with their protein choices, as I love goat, lamb and offal, but I have to say I would skip the kidney and testicle stew next time. It wasnt bad at all, just didnt measure up to the other offerings in terms of exuberant flavors.",

Go there, eat Sev Batata Poori, pomfret fry, paneer tikka. Definitely have the only dessert on the menu. It would be wise to bring an extra handkerchief for your sniffles.

Got the goat neck biryani and it was incredible. The eggplant beguni was also the perfect texture of super crispy on the outside and super creamy on the inside. Overall, Id definitely say that the food is definitely on the spice heavy side so Id recommend getting a raita on the side if spicy food is not your cup of tea. The drinks here were also incredibly dank. I also wanted to mention that the service here was absolutely fantastic. I feel bad because we got nervous about the outdoor dining situation and requested to have some sort of ventilation and then ended up running late (so we were definitely THOSE diners), but the staff here was incredibly accommodating. Im truly looking forward to coming back here in the near future (hopefully with my parents!).",

As someone who has eaten at plenty of mediocre-generic Indian restaurants (that I can only assume are incredibly Americanized), Dhamaka is a breath of fresh air. Every dish we ate had unique and incredible flavors. The same can be said for the drinks. I will say, my partner and I arent used to eating spicey foods. Some of the dishes came right up to the edge of our tolerable spice levels, but never went overboard. If you cant handle heat at all, Id recommend you ask which dishes are on the milder side. If youre up for it, Id highly recommend ignoring this advice as the spice complimented the flavors well. The staff were friendly, as well as the owner who checked in and gave us some background into the origins of the food. Lastly, the ambiance felt sophisticated yet fun and joyful. Great place for a nice dinner.",

I had the Gulaabo cocktail   so delicious not too sweet and it had such a cute flower in it. The food speaks for itself everything was spiced and cooked perfectly. The highlight was the paplet fry appetizer and champaran meat entree. Kudos to the chef the food is brilliant. The owner stopped by our table multiple times which I appreciated   made us feel so welcome and joked we could eat the fish with our hands   small things like this are what stands out. Also loved the Punjabi music :) location in LES Essex street market is awesome too   looking forward to coming back and when they have their outdoor seating open.",

Not pictured were gobi keema and murgh seekh, which were too tasty and fresh to pause for photos. The pao melts in your mouth with the gobi. Best way to describe food: high attention to detail and freshness, yet tastes home-cooked, authentic, and packed with flavor. We had hesitation about placing such high hopes on a place called Dhamaka, Hindi for bang, but Im more than happy to report that this place lives up to its name.",

                "review_text": "Finally! Something that we have been yearning for a long time - a high quality Indian restaurant showcasing the diversity of Indias regional cuisine, not typically seen in Indian restaurants in US. Chef Chintan Pandya and restaurateur Roni Mazumdar have totally hit it out of the park!! First day, first seating! We were fortunate to have an opportunity to experience the exceptional cuisine and warm hospitality of Chef Chintan and his team. - Loved the Joshila cocktail - perfect blend of mezcal, green chili & passion fruit. Paan-E-Bahar could benefit from some more ginger liquer. - Each regional dish was perfectly executed, and authentic in its flavors. We covered quite a spectrum: Bharela Marcha (Gujarat), Paplet (Mumbai/Goa), Doh Khleh (Meghalaya), Goat Belly Seekh, Champaran Mutton (Bihar), Macher Jhol (Bengal), and Chena Poda (Odisha). - Champaran Mutton stood out as the signature dish. Marinated for 24 hrs, and slow cooked in an earthen pot for 4 hrs. We had always thought of goat meat as mutton, but Chef Chintan was very kind to explain to us that mutton is from a 3 yr old sheep. With the decline of wool industry, older sheep are hard to find - so the mutton is sourced from Arizona and flown in fresh. It was cooked beautifully - with the smoky flavor of mustard oil, well balanced with the sweetness of a whole bulb of garlic. Dhamaka has arrived with a bang! We would highly recommend Dhamaka to anyone who wants to experience the amazing flavors that regional Indian cuisine has to offer. The high quality ingredients, balanced flavors, and the famous Indian hospitality truly shines in this restaurant.",
