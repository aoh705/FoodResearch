The paratha is a sizeable portion which was good to see. For desert I would say you can skip the pista cream it s just a pistachio custard.

Unfortunately that was the only good part of our visit. The chai was okay and was luke warm. Should probably be called  not so garam chai . We also tried the hariyali egg dish. The dish was cold for some reason. The scrambled egg tadka that they add on the table was hot but the sunny side up and the green sauce that the egg was sitting on was room temp. This made the whole dish cold while eating. When we told the server that the dish was cold (just to inform them and not to get a free dish or something) she said the green sauce is stored in the fridge and then added to the plate to straight without heating it. She said she will relay this feedback to the kitchen. Not sure if that s how it s supposed to be but we were not fans of Luke warm food. We ordered chapati which came in really hot and compensated for the cold egg. Overall the experience was okay. There was spice and flavor in everything but lacking in a few areas.

The restaurant itself is large and spacious. Its really hard to get a reservation here so after booking a month in advance it was great to sit at a table for two and have plenty of space to dine comfortably. Bollywood music was playing overhead and overall the place had a great vibe. SERVICE Also great! Our server was attentive and gave recommendations on the food when we asked him to help us choose between two dishes. FOOD Okay so here is where my qualm starts. The food was good. Here is the breakdown solely on flavor: Papri Chaat (3/5): The spice level was great but the papri was very strange... it was super thick and hard and difficult to eat... it didnt soak in the yogurt like it should have Prawn (4.5/5): The flavor is great. However, even though it looks quite extravagant its really only 2-3 bites of deliciousness. Paneer (3/5): The dish itself was pretty oily (similar to a few other dishes judging from other reviews) and there was strong flavors from mace and methi which could be a bit overwhelming in certain bites. Dessert (4/5): Came warm which was unique. Im used to cool desserts but I loved the burnt edges of this dessert. I could have excused the food given the excellent service and the vibes. But the price! $14 for the prawn is a bit outlandish. The dessert which was a rice pudding-esque dessert was $12. We ordered a mango lassi and it was $9 (!!?). The raita on the side is also $3. Overall, I thought the food was good. But Id rather go to somewhere in Flushing or Jackson Heights to get similar quality food at half or third the price.

Both were fall off the bone yummy with awesome flavors we had never tasted before.  Really good.  Azad said the mutton was an 8 out of 10 hot but if you have the spicy sauce at a Mexican joint you will be ok with Dhamakas 8 out of 10.  The goat neck was a 6 out of 10 so not too spicy but really yummy.  They only have one dessert which is like a cheesecake.  It is really good but it is small so you may want to get 2 of them.

I had a horrendous experience at dhamaka and judging by some of the other reviews, Im not the only one. The problem is not the food. It is the management and the attitude of the host. This review is specifically for the manager Tina Dholikar. Im horrified that such a acclaimed restaurant would hire someone this devoid of common courtesy and manners. We were late for our reservation by 15 minutes due to the traffic and Tina refused to seat us. It was a full restaurant and food coming in for the tables and yet she refused to seat us. We had asked for the manager at which she said that would be me, I know I dont look like it, but I am. Indeed she did not sound or look like a floor manager who knows how to talk to customers. She went on and on about how it would be disrespectful to the chef and his time and yet it was perfectly fine that we wasted 30 minutes rushing to get to our reservation. She spoke back to us three separate times. It is perfectly fine for a manager to say that they cannot accommodate a guest as they missed their reservation but there is a way to do it. Being antagonistic and rude to the customer all the while making a huge deal blaming them for being late is not the way. We then asked if she had a business card in case we needed to get in touch with the owner, she replied sorry, we dont like to cut trees. I then said those are basic marketing materials to which she replied we are looking for a certain type of diner and are not trying to market our restaurant to everyone. Im sorry, but this is beyond acceptable and she would be fired on the spot at any other decent restaurant. I get that your restaurant is enjoying good reviews now, but having horrible staff like this really makes your restaurant look very undesirable. There are a million restaurants in NYC and no one needs to come to dhamaka. We ended up going to a wonderful Indian spot that did accommodate us and was very courteous. We will be sending everyone there. I would really prefer to not waste my precious holiday time writing a review, but it was beyond rude and sorry, but awful attitude like this will only beget aa very negative reputation.

From my observations, it seems there is a really poor manager whose complete lack of professionalism is impacting other staff and the overall service. The protein in one of our dishes was inedible. I ve had this dish previously at Dhamaka and ordered it again because I really enjoyed it. Since we couldn t eat the dish, we mentioned it to our server (who seemed new and really uncomfortable and uncertain throughout the entire visit, even before this point). The server went to relay our feedback to management and then came back to the table and inexplicably started arguing with us, telling us the dish was fine. We again politely explained that the sauce was flavorful but the protein was off and we couldn t eat any of it (it was basically just bones, no meat, and the tiny shreds of chicken were either severely overcooked, or undercooked, we couldn t even tell because it didn t resemble chicken in any capacity). After another back and forth of her going to speak to the manager, and a long awkward pause where no solution or apology was offered (the normal response at a restaurant of this caliber would be to replace the dish with something else, comp a glass of wine, offer us dessert .something/anything other than being argumentative), we reiterated our feedback and the server again began arguing that the dish was fine. As our plates were being cleared, the server inexplicably asked if we d like the food boxed to take home. No, no thanks. At this point, we asked that the dish be removed from our bill, because it was clear that Dhamaka had no interest in rectifying the situation. The sever had to ask the manager, and then came back and told us there was nothing that could be done since we had eaten the food. The same food that she had just offered to box up for us 2 minutes prior because there was so much left. At this point, as she picked her third argument with us, we just wanted to get out there asap and as we were leaving, mentioned the situation to another member of the staff who basically shrugged. On the walk out, I will note that one kind staffer pulled us aside and apologized, but said they weren t empowered to help because of the manager. But made it clear they realized what happened and how terribly the situation was handled. The Unapologetic Foods group should really take note of what s happening at its restaurants and get  management  some hospitality training asap.

And it s just generally hard to get reservations here. The menu was very limited and few of their menu items were not available. They have a weird rule that you can only order main course items all that you want together once. Their portion sizes are very small compared to the price charged. IMO it s very expensive. The paneer tikka from grill section was for $21 and they only serve 2 pieces of it. Food is delicious no doubt but is also that much oily! I don t think I would ever go there again. There are other Indian cuisine restaurants that serve similar delicious food and are reasonably priced. Please see pictures for reference.

The Nagaland Pork is good but very fatty. So if youre not into fatty things I would stay away. Otherwise, its not as flavorful but definitely had a good taste. The Nalli Briyani was simply amazing. They have a lamb chuck cooked, and when they open up the pot, it literally slides off the bone. The Kolambi Ani Kekda was good but definitely will feel more seafood like. So if youre looking for a better approach for seafood can go with this type of rice. If not I wouldnt recommend it since it will be an explosion of seafood taste. The drinks I would probably say are on the more expensive side but I feel like its only good to order for the experience of trying out their alcoholic mixtures being different.

It was so fiery that none of the other flavors that are so typical of a well-made biriyani, came through. The lamb shank was such a great idea but the dish is very poorly executed.

Honestly, this paired with two appetizers could probably feed a group of 4. Lasooni lobster had great flavor but a bit too salty for my taste. The Nagaland pork - you really have to like pork belly to get into this one. My tablemates loved this dish but personally, it wasnt for me.

Bartender was great about 1) explaining the new menu to us. 2) when I asked about the Chaas mocktail, he let me try a sample - - I disliked it, and appreciated the sample! 3) gave us an extra paratha when he said the first looked burnt. 4) staff offered sample tasters (eg the size of an ice cream parlor sample) of the desserts, which we appreciated. We heard a comment from one staff member (management?) who criticized the bartender for not pushing more cocktails on customers, which made us a little uncomfortable. As in 2021, spicy flavors were intense, but this time it didnt distract me in the way it had then. Unsure if the difference was my mental preparedness or the food. ___ Oct 2021 By group consensus, the winners of the night were the biryani and lasooni prawns.

Out of the several times I dined here, the biryani was the only disappointing dish. It s good, but there are so many better items on the menu that I regretted not getting something else. The dessert is unique, like a Basque burnt cheesecake but gooey and slightly savory. All that dairy helps get rid of the heat on your tongue before you leave the restaurant.

I grew up eating South Asian food but consider myself to have relatively low spice tolerance; the food here was not as spicy as I was expecting after reading the reviews, but it was still a bit too spicy to be comfortable. The passionfruit mango lassi and the parathas definitely helped to assuage my mouth. The service was polite and nice. I would eat here again if they would manage the spiciness levels. Our server proactively told us that the entrees are made from scratch, yet when we asked if they could make the spiciness mild, he said the chef wont do that because he wants to stay true to his vision for the food. Perhaps once the hype around this place simmers down, they will be a bit more flexible on this.

Its unapologetic and elevated if you like shocking your tastebuds into submission (or clearing your sinus) with Instagrammable but overly spiced fatty meats on bone floating in 2 inches of oil and ghee. Im from South East Asia; I have a good spice tolerance and like a challenge. I bring along my own birds eye chillies to Thai and Vietnamese joints.  Even for me, the masala and aromatics like cardamoms were overdone on every dish at Dhamaka. I appreciate bold flavors in general but there is a point of diminishing return when you dont know what youre tasting because you are getting slapped by everything everywhere all at once. Pretty far off from any semblance of home cooking or comfort food.

We had two appetizers, two entrees and a side order of the chapatis and a 1947 beer which came out to a total of $180 including a 20% gratuity. The pros: Both appetizers were ample and enough for four people. We had the Ragda Pattice a potato patty, white pea, green chili   and the Ajwani Paneer Tikka a house-made paneer, garam masala which we had to stop eating to leave room for our main course. The entree portions were even more generous in size and we realized we ordered way too much food.  The Goat Neck Dum Biryani a braised goat neck, Basmati rice, saffron was delicious with the right amount of heat.  The Lamb Shank Nihari with black cardamom, fried onion, tomato come in a medium sized stainless steel pot and reminded me of my mother s cooking.  This dish was spicier that the goat. An order of chapatis was not enough to accompany this dish and a side of basmati rice would be ideal. Twenty minutes into the meal we realized we had ordered enough for four people.  Noted for next time. The waitstaff is attentive but not overbearing.  They promptly refilled the glasses of water whenever it was low - essential with the spice level of some of the dishes. Cons: it s loud!  Every seat inside and out was occupied on a cold November evening at 7 pm so the noise level was loud to begin with and adding the pounding soundtrack of bhangra and other Bollywood tracks didn t help. We had the unfortunate luck of being two seats away from a party of six which included one woman who was especially loud throughout the entire meal - at several points we thought she was in distress or about to start an altercation but no, just an extremely loud person unaware of the social mores of eating at a restaurant. Our seat was adjacent to the half wall leading to the lone restroom so we always had either the open door or a persona waiting in line in our peripheral vision.  Perhaps they can add a curtain or extend the wall to ensure that lucky diner in this seat has a better experience. The reservation process is still a pain (while democratic). We had to book about a month and a half ahead of time by waiting for midnight when the spots become open by hitting refresh on the browser and having a quick trigger finger.

Honestly there was no taste to it except for mustard taste and heavy fried smell. Then we got Bharela Marcha sweet peppers, peanuts, fresh coriander.

I finished one (1) dish and had to take the rest back to my hotel room, which wasn t ideal since I was leaving the next day and wouldn t have time to eat it all. So I just kind of feel like he deliberately upcharged me. I even at the end said,  It was way too much food!  When he asked how it was and he didn t respond at all lol. I also had a weirdly long wait between my apps and entree with no explanation, even though he had said the entree was on its way when it didn t actually arrive until 20-30 minutes later. So idk.

Not mentioned below (due to character limit) are the grilled paneer and the Ragda Pattice (both great). I ve had most of the grilled menu at this point and it s all delicious. Papdi chaat - A beautiful medley of yogurt, chili-cilantro hari chutney, tamarind, and chaat masala with a pop of pomegranate to mix things up a bit. And, of course, that signature dhamaka spice. Every bite is a flavor explosion. If you haven t had chaat before, I d recommend this dish over any other. My favorite and they do it perfectly! Gurda kapoora - Testicles and kidneys! And chilies! Spicccyyyyy. And buttery. All in a rich, fragrant, fiery tomato gravy. Not for the faint of heart and not for the average eater. But get past your reticence, soak all that up in some crispy and buttery pav (bread roll), and you have yourself a wonderful concoction reminiscent of your favorite hearty chili. If you re lucky enough to come on a night when this isn t sold out (seriously), I highly recommend adding this to your order. Paplet Fry - if you hadn t guessed yet, I m Indian. But My household did not do seafood outside of a tilapia fillet fry every so often. So when I get a chance to experience the way that my people do seafood, I m always appreciative of the experience. The seasoning on this dish is perfect granting a tangy and flavorful playfulness that bounces off the crispness of the fish wonderfully. Add to that some pickled red onions and cilantro-chili chutney if you must, I honestly felt it didn t need anything else. (Probably my Atlanta side telling me that I miss fried fish in the south). Goat Belly Seekh - I ve had plenty of seekh kabobs but this one is truly unique. Their means of grilling this spicy concoction? Wrapping it in wood to create a convection oven effect and letting it soak in the juices that would otherwise fall out if baked in such a manner. Genius. We also had a brief conversation with Chef Pandya before our dinner, who recommended this as his favorite item. So we ordered 3. Fresh roti! They asked so I will never turn it down. Not the best roti I ever had but happy to have it all the same. Lamb Shank Nihari - Y all. So many amazing plates during this visit, and so many things that I d absolutely get again, but this was tonight s standout. I make a damn good nihari at home, so my standards are high, and of course, I m always looking to compare. There are components that you need to get correct in order to do this dish right I ve never had lamb in a nihari so I was curious how the changeup would sit with me. It sat just fine. Right off the bat (bone), the lamb melted into the gravy. Meat, check. Thickness and consistency, check. Spice, check check check (Chef Pandya never disappoints in spice). And it all comes together beautifully. You can have nihari at home 2/3x a week and still come here and feel like you re getting something different. But something that really holds true to the essence of what a nihari should be. A+ dish. Goat Neck Dum Biryani. We had some Hyderabadis in our party so we tend to be particular when it comes to a good biryani. Personally, I felt it held up, but it didn t wow me. But others in our party loved it, and one even said it s as good as any Hyderabadi biryani that he s had. One unique component: there is a layer of spice (because of course there is) on the dum lid. I recommend using this as your carb-vessel with all other dishes. You re welcome. Champaran meat - this was a new dish for me, I d never heard of it or tried it. If you love garlic (let s be honest, who doesn t), this is the dish for you. A full head of garlic was the first thing I caught in my roti -  didn t realize that until my second bite but I wasn t at all mad about it. The meat is tender and altogether this is a tasty dish, recommended by Chef Pandya as well. My thoughts? Too many things I love on this menu, and too many things I ve yet to try for me to come back to this one.",a year ago,2023-04-12 12:19:56.502852,,,,0,53,267,True,,

We chatted with the host and since it was our first time in the market, she recommended we look around and see the bars downstairs. We took the look around and decided to come back up to Dhamaka to eat. We asked to put our name on the wait list and went back downstairs to have a drink until our table was ready. Our table was now ready, and my boyfriend went up to retrieve our table while I closed out the bill at the bar downstairs. He then called me because he said he was not allowed to sit until I was present. Now mind you, the host saw he and I together twice. So why could he not get sat? Even if policy is that all guest must be present to sit down, to me a table for a party of 2 is the same size as if 1 person came in to dine. Now if we said 4 people and they only saw 2, the policy makes sense, but that was not the case. We were seated and the woman who sat us proceeded to say we only have an hour and fifteen minutes because we were walk-ins. Cool, no problem. Now our server comes and repeats the same thing the woman said who sat us. I was a bit irritated at this point because I felt rushed. He back within less than 2 minutes and asked if we ready. Mind you it s our first time there, so no, I am not ready and asks him  Can we have a minute . He comes back, I have questions about the menu, and he answers them and now everything seems to fine. He said the food would take about 30 minutes to come out because its fresh and it actually came out sooner, so my boyfriend and I were happy. We finished our delicious meal, paid for it, and went to the bathroom before we left the premises. My boyfriend is looking for the bathroom and the bartender chimes in and says  Can I help you . My boyfriend replies  we just ate here and are looking for the bathroom . He then says  you have to go downstairs  Mind you we had just finished our meal at the establishment. At this point I am even more irritated because how dare this man not listen to my boyfriend when he specifically said we just ate here and are looking for the bathroom. One of the hosts then makes eye contact with the bartender as if it is okay for us to proceed. That honestly made me upset because he didn t even ask questions and wanted to send us somewhere else far from the bathroom that was in close proximity to where we were standing.

I ve been trying for some time to get the ever elusive rabbit dish so I was so excited to finally reserve it a month before my reservation for a prime weekend time. It made it hard to wait for that long but it surely didn t disappoint. This dish is truly a one of kind experience. Yes, not just a meal, but an entire experience. Our waitress (Lila) and the story she told about the dish and the restaurant really took this to another level. The restaurant is labeled as unapologetic Indian, which is a great way to describe how this dish came to be. You can read all about the backstory elsewhere, but it makes it feel special to understand everything that goes into this. The rabbit itself is spectacular, cooked in a sealed pot after making a trip from upstate New York days earlier and then marinating for some time. It s so tender and just goes perfectly with whatever sauce it s cooked in. It s spicy for sure - you know that going in and you start to notice that immediately. The rabbit itself is served whole, head, organs, and everything else. For those of you who are adventurous like me, I highly recommend try every piece of this animal. It s part of what makes it so special, given that most foods we eat aren t prepared whole like this (besides fish). On the side, they provide some bread to dip into any of the array of options, which included an incredible lentil dish and a spicy potato side. Those lentils were maybe the best I ve had and complement the other dishes well (mostly because they provide some relief from the spice). Don t worry, they also give you a bit of yogurt and rice in case the lentils aren t enough to cool your mouth. Lila (waitress) really made this meal additionally special so I definitely want to make sure she gets the shoutout. Not only was she very attentive, but she was clearly enjoying our experience and entertained our questions, curiosity, and general wackiness of three 20-somethings out at dinner. I m really glad that a place like this exists to push the boundaries on cuisine by introducing truly unique dishes. I really enjoyed their other restaurant Adda (Long Island City) when I went a few years ago and consistently enjoy (read: love) my constant trips to Angel (Jackson Heights), which is helmed by a former Adda chef.

Food falls flat on flavor whilst still being a slap in your face with heat. My hunch is that many of the reviewers are mistaking heat for flavor. Heads up: The menu is limited for vegetarians and appetizers are better than mains. We got papdi chat and ragda pattice for apps. Ragda pattice was excellent and papdi chat was good but not true to the Punjabi style papdi chat. Anyhow, whatever it was, it was good. For mains, we got the paneer methi dish with paratha. The paratha again wasn t authentically Punjabi and had a processed/pre-made taste. The paneer was incredibly fresh but the methi leaves needed to be cooked more. The gravy was heavy on cinnamon (found a 5 inch cinnamon bark) and had an unpleasant bitter taste from the uncooked methi. The flavor profile absolutely needs more balancing and the recipe needs more cooking time. Cocktails are great! Overall, over-priced for what it is given that the restaurant is just an area sectioned off in a food hall. Meat eaters will likely have a better experience with food here. Lots of choices. I ve tried Adda, Dhamaka and Rowdy Rooster and it seems that unapologetic foods does street eats and chaat well but not mains and curries. I find them over-hyped for this reason.

The pomfret fry was my favorite. Also, I found the ambiance to be a bit confused and I still don t understand why an Indian restaurant that is trying to be different must still feel the need to play blaring mainstream Bollywood music that makes it so difficult to have a decent conversation, also when there are so many diverse genre of Indian music to choose from.

Quite steep I say. After a doctors appointment we managed to show up on time, because it was a friendly team who had opened another restaurant in the city! We were seated within 15 minutes by an extremely helpful and attentive team. It was 4 adults and our 2 year old who was seated in his very comfortable high chair. What we liked: the appetizers, cocktails, and service was very nice. Very flavorful, packed with taste and punch! Most cocktails cost $18 and Paan-E-Bahar + City Harvest was a winner. If you like the flavor of Paan, this drink is packed with that taste! Appetizers are priced well, Bharela Marcha (3 pcs) ($9) and Ajwani Paneer Tikka - 2 pieces ($13) were absolutely delicious. The Paneer was very fresh and definitely felt like homemade! What we did not like: Pricing! I understand its Delancey street, but its definitely not that expensive to rent a shared space. Food is good, but some of the entrees are a little too expensive. $29 for a veggie pulao is a bit much, no matter how much you jazz it up with a super star chef level with some super flavored mix is masalas. Served in a nice mini pressure cooker the dish looks very inviting and is tasty. Goat Neck Dum Biryani at $39 comes in a relatively large portion which was shared by 3 people. I wish the portion size is reduced and the price, so we couldve tried a few other mains which we couldnt. One thing that definitely stands out is they dont ask for desired spice level, and the spice level is absolutely perfect (slightly on the spicier side). We absolutely loved the food, so Chintan - well done again! There was also one point in time in the evening where the music was very loud for us to have conversations.

The prawn grill only came with one and although it was tasty Id try the peanut and pepper grill next time. The paneer methi main course is big ! And delicious. Recommended. I took some home with me. Rice doesnt come with the mains so order some on the side. My friend got the baby shark and this was also surprisingly good, different and had a lot of meat in it. As far as bread , I thought the Chapati was better than the paratha but I wish the Chapati was bigger ( wish they had naan actually! ) The drinks arent too big but they were also flavorful and unique. My friend got two of the NRI which is a tasty coconut milk and scotch and Cointreau drink, tasty. I got the betel leaf and gin and ginger liqueur Paan e Bahar drink and that was nice and definitely different. I also got the mezcal and passion fruit Joshila drink and even for someone who doesnt like mezcal it was good because the fruit cuts a lot of the smokiness.

ChIJJyPbJe1ZwokRu8dDEOqAYDc,Dhamaka,d014501264cd684c811ef284d744e863,1,"Unimpressive. Pretentious. Expensive. I have a very high bar for Indian food. From authentic true to its roots dishes, to brave fusions that stretch the rich culinary heritage of India while taking creative leaps. When we looked at the menu at Dhamaka it had the makings of a promising hip Indian restaurant that seemed to balance both. The reality was sadly far from it. We ordered plenty of food. With each dish being regrettably worse than the other. The fish and the lamb chops are just doused in spice mix that makes you wonder if it was the spice mix that was main dish being served with protein as an accompaniment. The oil in the biryani left a horrible after taste. The kind that sticks to roof of your mouth and leaves you feeling gassy later. The chicken can only be taken down with the chutney and pickled onion they give on the side. The chicken kofta is overpowered by the mustard in the curry and might I tell you feels terribly undone to begin with. The masala in kofta seemed to be uncooked - could have spent some time being sauteed to remove the raw taste of what I m sure is the same spice mix. If you take a closer look at the photos on Google Maps or the dishes in person the overpowering use of this spice mix will seem evident. Every dish either garnished by it or cooked with it. Which is probably why all their dishes seem to lack any kind of structure and depth. Like a young grad who left home from India to study in the US, recreating the flavors of home, with the overbearing use of this spice mix. There is one stand out dish that deserves five whole stars on its own. This is the only dessert the restaurant serves -  Chenna Poda  from the humble lands of Nayagarh, Odisha in India. Everything about this dish makes me yearn for what this restaurant could have been. Everything about this dessert is the promise and potential this restaurant has but is clearly too self occupied pretending to be something it cannot to notice. The simplicity of the dish, the humility of the clay bowls and banana leaf it s served in, and the regal taste for what very much is a village treat.

The goat belly from the grills was also outstanding - like a loosely packed sausage studded with bright herbs and a perfect amount of fat.

I had the Gulaabo cocktail   so delicious not too sweet and it had such a cute flower in it. The food speaks for itself everything was spiced and cooked perfectly. The highlight was the paplet fry appetizer and champaran meat entree. Kudos to the chef the food is brilliant. The owner stopped by our table multiple times which I appreciated   made us feel so welcome and joked we could eat the fish with our hands   small things like this are what stands out. Also loved the Punjabi music :) location in LES Essex street market is awesome too   looking forward to coming back and when they have their outdoor seating open.",3 years ago,2021-04-12 12:20:18.986345,,,,0,2,,False,,

Not pictured were gobi keema and murgh seekh, which were too tasty and fresh to pause for photos. The pao melts in your mouth with the gobi. Best way to describe food: high attention to detail and freshness, yet tastes home-cooked, authentic, and packed with flavor. We had hesitation about placing such high hopes on a place called Dhamaka, Hindi for bang, but Im more than happy to report that this place lives up to its name.",3 years ago,2021-04-12 12:20:18.995652,,,,2,423,818,True,,

Something that we have been yearning for a long time - a high quality Indian restaurant showcasing the diversity of Indias regional cuisine, not typically seen in Indian restaurants in US. Chef Chintan Pandya and restaurateur Roni Mazumdar have totally hit it out of the park!! First day, first seating! We were fortunate to have an opportunity to experience the exceptional cuisine and warm hospitality of Chef Chintan and his team. - Loved the Joshila cocktail - perfect blend of mezcal, green chili & passion fruit. Paan-E-Bahar could benefit from some more ginger liquer. - Each regional dish was perfectly executed, and authentic in its flavors. We covered quite a spectrum: Bharela Marcha (Gujarat), Paplet (Mumbai/Goa), Doh Khleh (Meghalaya), Goat Belly Seekh, Champaran Mutton (Bihar), Macher Jhol (Bengal), and Chena Poda (Odisha). - Champaran Mutton stood out as the signature dish. Marinated for 24 hrs, and slow cooked in an earthen pot for 4 hrs. We had always thought of goat meat as mutton, but Chef Chintan was very kind to explain to us that mutton is from a 3 yr old sheep. With the decline of wool industry, older sheep are hard to find - so the mutton is sourced from Arizona and flown in fresh. It was cooked beautifully - with the smoky flavor of mustard oil, well balanced with the sweetness of a whole bulb of garlic. Dhamaka has arrived with a bang! We would highly recommend Dhamaka to anyone who wants to experience the amazing flavors that regional Indian cuisine has to offer. The high quality ingredients, balanced flavors, and the famous Indian hospitality truly shines in this restaurant.",3 years ago,2021-04-12 12:20:19.422191,,,,0,3,,False,,
