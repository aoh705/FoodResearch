And for the meat menu, I ordered lamb and pork belly. The pork belly was really delicious, and my mom left the lamb meat because it was a bit smelly so she couldnt eat it. So, mint sauce? I asked if they had any, and they said they didnt have any, so I couldnt eat the meat. But the pork belly I ordered was super delicious! Kimchi and cucumber cabbage are served as side dishes, and the kimchi tastes like Korean kimchi. Its delicious~~!!!!! While eating it, it was nice to feel the wonder of Korean food being reinterpreted in this way! I also packed the chicken because the sauce was delicious >__< For two women who ordered chicken as well, the quantity was small. There were too many!! I packed it up and brought it to you the next morning. I ate it lol If you order it like this, it will cost about $250.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the lean, flaky texture of the fluke. The slight chewiness helps you appreciate the sweetness of the strawberries, the fragrance of the shiso, and the tanginess of the seafood soup. XO Scallops with Orange Slices - an upgrade over the regular menu features the freshest scallops, swimming in a pool of umami, the crunchy fragrance of the xo sauce, paired with a perfectly tart slice of orange and breadcrumbs to create a melody of all the pleasant flavors that you can imagine in your mouth. Broccolini with Creme Fraiche, Pine Nuts. - Broccolini and garlic scapes infused with a delicious buttery flavour are a great way to eat your veggies, especially if you provide a simple yet tasty addition of pine nuts, and a generous portion of creme fraiche to layer on that indulgence Prawn Mandu with Corn and Creamy Lobster Soup. - What lies underneath a delicately thin layer of crisp, is a juicy and crispy bite of mashed shrimp. Once you bite down, an explosion of fresh shrimp flavour breaks out, as the creaminess of the foie gras and lobster broth caresses your tongue. Fried Chicken with Peanut Sauce and Gochujang - The definition of a delicately fried, JUICY pieces of chicken. Something so good its worth burning your mouth for. Past that crispy, golden veil is a mouth-watering, moist piece of chicken that shows its full potential when dipped in a tangy gochujang sauce or a fragrant, nutty peanut sauce that I will admit, is lacking in abundance because I loved it so much Pork Belly with Potato Puree and Enoki Mushrooms - fatty pieces of roasted pork belly thats tender and pairs well with the rice. The potato puree tasted like potato but also a like sour and cheesy. Also came with some fresh herb. Steamed Halibut in Sweet Halibut Soup and Congee - This halibut is cooked wonderfully, flaky, sound and fall apart in your mouth, served with a sweet, umami soup based on the natural flavours of the fish, and garnished with chives for that extra fragrance. I also typically dont like congee. Chocolate Mousse - A deep, rich and smooth chocolate outer layer encompasses a smooth but marshmallow-y texture from the ingenious rice cakes that are incorporated into the mousse on the inside. The result is a decadent, chocolatey goodness that melts in your mouth, topped with a cocoa crumble to add that extra tickle of chocolate in your nose. Granita - the only complaint is the portion size here. This cinnamon based granita is a first experience for me, a literal melt-in-your-mouth texture with a pleasant spice from the cinnamon, paired with a perfectly not-to-sweet lychee yoghurt which is smooth as butter, and a layer of burrata to add that extra creaminess. The walnuts are also indispensable to rounding out the texture to make should that this dish doesnt fall flat.

Neat trick they replay so you dont walk out hungry: a huge bowl of rice for the main. Without it, you would def walk out hungry. Also very aggressive upselling at every corner of the menu, e.g., 18 dollars extra to switch the main from pork to octopus. Nice try. We sat towards the back, and its just a very unpleasant atmosphere, as there is a constant stream of rushed waiters running by (the restaurant is a long tunnel, so there is no other way to get service done of course). Service has to be quick, we get it, but its just a lot and we felt rushed the whole time (also we never knew if we had a dedicated waiter or not, and everybody was referring to someone else sadly). Probably avoid the Naegroni, its a sweetly fused something that has nothing to do with a Negroni, taste-wise. Maybe thats the idea, but it wasnt for me.

The composition sounded interesting but was not well executed. Too many ingredients that overpowered each other which resulted in not being able to taste anything but the shrimp. If I hadn t known I wouldn t have noticed the foie gras at all. What I also noticed was the food came out extremely fast. If you hadn t  finished a course yet, the next one was still placed on your table nevertheless. It was not at all pleasant to feel rushed while trying to enjoy each course. Besides bringing out the food way too fast, sometimes it was even served and the empty dishes did not get cleared. Very strange service. The pork belly dish was yet another disappointment. Mine was too dry, my friends pork belly was only fat. The dish and composition itself was boring and did not have the flavor I would have wished for. Desert was good but still not a single dish was really standing out to me. One last thing I found disappointing was, that there is no a la carte option.

For somewhere that was $75pp before add-ons, we got a bowl of shaved ice that had a SHARP HARD PIECE OF PLASTIC (pictured) inside of the dish that I had almost swallowed. When we showed the waitress, all we received was an apology and no other form of compensation. This piece of plastic was hard and sharp, almost like a broken piece of glass. Not to mention, the portions were way too small even for someone petite like me. My friend has a shellfish allergy and majority of the menu at the time was unable to accommodate. Furthermore, on the website, the menu included the Uni Bowl which was the whole reason why I wanted to give Atoboy a try. However, when we showed up, we were told that there was no Uni and that there would be a crab dish instead with an add-on price the same as the Uni dish. The service was underwhelming as I felt like the wait staffs did not present themselves professionally and did not seem as if they were familiar with their job. They were unable to give recommendations to dishes that would be safe to my friend s allergies. After discovering the dangerous sharp piece of plastic in my dessert, the only response we received was  we are so sorry . The piece of plastic was in the shaved ice and I had almost swallowed it. The only good dishes were the fried chicken and scallop which you needed to add-on an additional $28 and $12. Overall my friends and I were very disappointed in Atoboy as for meal which costed over $100pp in the end after add-ons and tax, it was not worth the price, judging on food alone.

Unlike its secretive and little upscale look from its outside, the inside looked like a comforting Asian diners, but ones in a movie with its minimal interior style and the lighting. The first thing that I loved about Atoboy was their Fried Chicken that you could add-on to your course. As a parent, I usually share course meals with my daughter as she wouldnt eat the most. I thought it was a smart idea to have Fried Chickens as add-on, then children could have smaller meals and their parents could also try for ourselves without overwhelming us. Their Fried Chickens were served with spicy peanut sauce and gochujang sauce, which were phenomenal together. A few other families seemed to do the same thing. The course was amazing and it packed a lot about Atoboy. Their Fried Chickens could easily steal everyones favorite votes with their flashy look and volume; In contrast, each dish in their course made me want to spend time quietly and digest each bite. Although entrees we had (Pork Belly and Cod) were good, I might pick Beet (smoked yogurt, strawberry chojang, and miyeok) for my most memorable dish for its uniqueness. Unlike other places, I would not worry about finishing their course as their portions were perfect. The course was $75 with hospitality fee included, which seemed amazing in the city.

I thought the dishes were well presented, but nothing out of this world for me. Portions are also small but satisfying imo. You can get KFC and other protein add ons if you desire something more filling. First course: summer squash tartlette with yukpo (dried beef floss). This tasted very rich, kind of like a squash soup on a tart. The dried meat didnt really shine through, felt like something citrus-y would have been interesting. Second: Fluke mulhwe. The fluke was quite cold / frozen, indicating the fish was not freshly cut. I think the dish would be stronger if the texture of a fresh fish or well defrosted one paired with the astringent chilli cold soup. Third: shrimp mandoo. Tasty filling, deep fry was nice touch, I would have expected steamed. The sweetness from the corn underneath paired well with the lobster broth. Fourth: halibut juk. My asian comfort food, so was excited for this one. The halibut was a bit overcooked, but the broth softened the bite. Paired with an umami seaweed seasoned rice, banchan (bell peppers) and cucumber kimchi. I thought the banchan and kimchi were alright, Ive had better. Fifth: Dessert granita. A cinammon bingsoo and lychee yogurt combo with walnuts. Very refreshing, and cold. I can see how the cinammon was combined to bring warmth, but I felt like the yogurt could have been a bit less chilled or whipped to give a better texture.

We cannot say amazing or outstanding, but it was just good. The first course is not actually a course, in other restaurants they call it a small treat from a chef. The second course - order scallops, they are amazing (fluke is nothing special, chrysanthemum salad is just okay); the third course I took sea urchin, it was good, but not so good for extra $27, it was too much tofu and so little sea urchin . Third course was tasty, but the lamb was over cooked, halibut is only good if you like it. Best thing ever was a bucket with chicken! And we expected korean kimchi, but it was kimchi made of broccolini stems. And omg, desert!!!!  Sorry, but it was VERY BAD. Guys, trust me, order a rice cake & do not go for that tempting lychee something. Jeeez that lychee+burata: ewwwwwww! I do not want to use strong words here , but ewwww! All plates with this desert are unfinished or even untouched (we paid attention when we were leaving). I think that should be a red flag for the chef. Service was really good. Nothing to say about that. The restaurant, the way it looks, is extremely cheap, plastic chairs, naked walls, holes in the walls, cheap cutlery (they do not change it through the courses), only tissue napkins are provided, nothing to put on your knees. The place has a very uncomfortable light. You expect something more intimate, but with this light you feel like you are eating in a surgical room. The other big issue is the space is super noisy, we heard everyones conversation, that was a bit disturbing. And of course, the check was giant. For 4 people it was $800 + tips. We ordered two bottles of wine, which was $200 total. Counting without wine it was still a pretty significant check for this place. When I pay that money, I do not expect to see people in joggers/sportswear or/and with their laptop with legs up on the chair & headphones working.

We arrived right on time, but we were seated behind the welcome kiosk right next to the door. Every time someone entered or exited the restaurant, we were blasted with cold air. It was a particularity windy night, and we had to resort to putting on our coats all throughout dinner. The pre-set five course meal was mediocre. The most memorable was the first dish (and not for the right reasons): an oyster set on a corn cake topped with some greens. It was hard to swallow - the oyster s gaminess overpowered the whole dish. Wish there were some acidic elements to balance out the dish. Favorites were the two desserts, they were fantastic. Other than that, I had a beer - a Pilsner, and it was 16 dollars.

Each course in the pre-fixe menu was all agreeable and masterful. The wagyu yukhye was fantastic - the beef was playfully chewy and had a tingle in spice. The yuzu was very subtle and enjoyable. On the other hand, the yellowtail was also excellent. It comes with potato strands for crunch, and a broccoli rabe for an unexpected bitterness. For the next course, the beet was a thick cut that was thus the dominant flavor. The contrast from the intensely sour finger lime was very enjoyable. The octopus had a delightful first bite: the sweet potato paste was an interesting combination. The highlight of the meal are the sunchokes, an original item from the restaurant s earlier years. It s an explosion of flavors with the truffle cream truly popping out. The sweet dashi and mushrooms are great together, while the orange is like a chaos factor. The deep fried cod comes in a fruity yet curried sauce. It has small chunks of fruits, while the chevre cheese adds a wonderful gaminess. It went well with rice. The pork belly was ok; it could ve been softer and didn t have any flavor by itself. The sauce was alright, but the sunchoke chips were nice. Desserts were excellent. The granita is impressively unique: elements of many different desserts you don t associate together come together - cinnamon, burrata, pecan, lychee. It was notably salted. The burnt cheesecake had a thorough smokey flavor. The caramel drizzle was lovely and it was dissonantly topped with fresh fruits.",2 years ago,2022-04-25 00:08:54.346954,,,,1,308,1476,True,,

ChIJZ-xpvadZwokRGVsoX2gW38s,Atoboy,eb408e6d67e65fdbb28d002778c65adf,5,"Solid Top 5 restaurants in NYC!!! Walked into this place unplanned with a friend, just because it s nearby. Didn t expect such creative menu and flawless cooking techniques!! My friend and I sat by the bar and shared the $46, three course prefix. It turned out to be the best dining experience for us! I ordered a jalapeno rosso cocktail. It was very spicy but intriguing. First course was a crab dish   minced crab meat with pomelo, citrus sauce and mayo on top. I ve never seen this combination before it was surprisingly delicious. The slight tartness of pomelo and citrus sauce highlights how freshly sweet the crab meat is, while the mayo adds more comfort through creaminess. It was lightweight, refreshing, and perfectly curious. Yes curious, we now became very curious of what can happen next. Second dish we ordered the pork and shrimp dish. We didn t expect it to look like a tonkatsu - fried pork cutlet, sliced. However the crust is so minimalistic, non-greasy, again light weight, barely-there that you forget it has the fried element to it. Inside is the state of a perfect meatball   smooth paste of pork and shrimp nicely blended together, while remaining their own integrity   you can taste the tiny difference in texture between pork and shrimp, and their distinct flavors, but nothing outshines another. It s accompanied by some gochujang (korean sweet chili paste) below and cilantro on top, which adds just enough aroma and contrast. The third dish was galbi. My friend and I are both korean bbq lovers, however we agree that often times when grilled meats are still pink or bloody in the center, they taste of a mix of raw and cooked, can be ignored but still flawed. This dish is different. The accuracy on timing is well reflected on the tenderness and seasoning. Though the portion is small, the dish yet again is full of sophisticated flavors. Home made potato chips and what seems like stir fried kimchi perfectly counteract any greasiness and adds fun little crisp to the texture. We cannot ignore the well thought (or rather cooked) details. The homemade apple kimchi expanded our horizons on kimchi, and we thank it for that. Who knew apples can be pickled, so well! The starter chips   home made seaweed chips were out of this world, we even inquired whether it can be packaged for sale. As southern Chinese (meaning Chinese born and raised in the southern provinces), both of us have high standard for rice. We added $2 for a bowl of sweet potato rice, and kept the other one the plain white rice. Both are exactly the same amount of fluffiness and have the perfect amount of water content   not too dry, not too wet / sticky. That s harder to achieve than you think, at least most restaurants I ve tried don t fit that bill. The sweet potato rice was another item we were head over heels for. According to the restaurant, they placed sweet potato on top of white rice to steam together, but actually don t blend the physical sweet potato to the rice. It was the best rice we ve ever had! So subtlety sweet, as if every piece of rice is soaked in the best quality sweet potato juice. It s not overly sweet. We agreed that we could eat this rice alone as snacks. Outside of the prefix, we ordered two desserts. One is shy from the other. We recommend the one with spruced honey on top. Can t remember this name unfortunately. All to conclude is this also was amazing. The spruced honey adds such interesting smokiness to the theme, and the red bean paste is one of the best we ve tried too. Hope this review is helpful! I can t wait to bring loved ones here again!

The deal here is that you get a tasting of 3 dishes per person and share it all family style. Everything can be split amongst multiple people. My friend and I went and got 6 dishes and split them.  Now that I know the deal, I ll come with at least 4 people next time. Why 4? Because we will cover most of the menu and yet still get at least 2 bites out of each dish. The sunchoke dish is amazing! Hands down the best of our batch. The sweet potato was lovely and served as a nice counterpoint to the sunchoke dish. They came at the same time (2nd course). The first course was a solid and more subtle start to the meal. The yellowtail was delicious and the golden beets both went beyond our expectations. I d have to say that everything so far has been perfectly balanced and had multiple textures and flavors on one plate. It showcases sophisticated flavor mapping and is consistently mindful of balance. Easier said than done people! The last course was the least impressive. We had the pork jowl and the octopus. The octopus was our least favorite. However, keep in mind that we both believed that at another restaurant we would have been pleased with this dish as it was. However, in light of the stiff competition on that menu, I d have to say that something had to come in last. The pork jowl wasn t as flavorful as I had hoped, but still a good dish. They were both just less inspired and execution of the flavors wasn t in the perfect balance and sophistication of the first 4 dishes. A waitress admitted that the 3rd course this season doesn t seem to be as strong as the first 2 courses. Oh well. But dessert...that sujjeongwa granita dessert was a perfect ending to the meal. It was refreshing, only slightly sweet and again, we are back to that wonderful flavor mapping and balance!

Hands: plates and cutleries are very designed, complimenting the food. Palate: king of the night. all food are flavoured just right, none are overpowering, great pairing of wines. Favorites of the night: yellowtail tuna, silk tofu and the mackerel! Service: with lactose and red meat intolerance the waitresses took great care to ensure that I had an outstanding choice of the menu, even reminding which plates I can have once the food is served.
