We started our evening with some unique and delicious drink. The Duck a Lorange, a Bulleit Bourbon-infused Peking Duck Fat Washed creation, was a definite winner. It set the tone for the night. For appetizers, we tried the Satay Beef Skewers   grilled beef skewers with turmeric garlic and lemongrass, served with a peanut butter sauce. The flavors were outstanding, and it was a great precursor to the main event. The Flaming Peking Duck stole the show. Perfected through generations, the duck was seasoned with a special blend of spices, dried for 8 hours, and then roasted to a crispy, golden brown perfection. Each bite was a celebration of Chinese culinary heritage, and we couldnt get enough. Moving on, the Wagyu Beef Dan Dan Noodles brought a spicy and rich Sichuan classic to our table. The Hot Stone-Seared Wagyu added a touch of theatricality   sizzling A5 Wagyu presented right in front of us. Our waiter Anthony was amazing. To cap off our culinary journey, we indulged in the Yum Cha Set, a delightful assortment of dim sum featuring pork, shrimp, fish, vegetable, and mushroom. Each bite was a burst of flavors, showcasing the culinary expertise of Golden Wuish. Leaving the restaurant, we couldnt help but feel grateful for the unforgettable evening. Golden Wuish The Duckhouse is more than just a dining spot; its an experience.

We started with non -alcoholic drinks the lechee drink and oolong moijto. Which was delicious and refreshing. I highly recommend the DIM SUM assorted platter. It was so good and beautifully presented. My husband got the beef platter which we asked for medium but came out rare. They fixed right away. I wanted the duck but they didn t sell half ducks on weekends. So I asked to take the bones home if I got whole duck which was $88 for whole duck. The waitress said yes so I ordered it. The flaming duck was cool to see the cutter sliced it up nicely. They served the duck 3 ways, roasted, smoked and in a soup. The duck was delicious, but the soup never came out so I asked for it to go. I also asked for the bones, the waiter then says it s an ADDITIONAL $10 for the bones?!!! Why did I pay $88 for whole duck. That annoyed me!  I felt like that was a scam!  Tell me in the beginning! It s very over price for the amount of duck you actually get, the soup also has tiny chucks of duck meat when I looked it at home. We also started off with sesame chicken small plate to share! The chicken was tender and not too sweet!! So good! Over all the service was friendly but tricky with additional charges and forgot my soup. The restaurant is super charming and cozy!

Go for the whole peking duck experience where they roll the whole biped out on a trolley,  light it on fire and dispatch the bird in three ways (Peking duck wraps, smoked slices, and duck soup).  The wraps were paper things which were appreciated and included the typical condiments ie thinly sliced cucumbers, green onion, and hoisin sauce. The duck skin was crispy,  and the meat moist. The slices were placed on a decorative platter. The Yum Cha set dim sum sampler really brought back memories of my grandma. Besides pretty much every sample being delicious,  it was an emotional experience as well. We also ordered the wagyu beef Dan Dan noodle which had bouncy strands an overall medium spiciness to it. It was tasty, but the wagyu is diced small and therefore they are fully cooked throughout.  Not a bad thing served in this manner but I feel wagyu should always by had rare or at most, medium rare and in slices. We were so stuffed and skipped dessert.

The food was absolutely fanatic, 5 stars all around. The Peking duck was by far the best Ive ever had - we were fighting over pieces of crispy skin. So flavorful and wonderful! The roast boneless spare ribs with honey are an absolute must-order appetizer. Although the meat is served off the bone, you get everything youd expect (crispy, fatty, melty) from a traditional spare ribs. I made this gesture   after my first bite! Theyre quite different than Dads Spare Ribs, which we were also served. Dads come on the bone and are made with five spice to hit every type of taste, and were super juicy and fun to eat. If I had to choose between the two, though, Id go with honey roasted. The lamb chops with cumin had an excellent sear, and the crispy cumin and other aromatics really elevated the dish. Loved the flavors and the texture, some of the best lamb Ive ever been served. The signature dim sum was great, too. We loved the presentation and the sauces that came with it. It would be a great app to share or eat all for yourself.
