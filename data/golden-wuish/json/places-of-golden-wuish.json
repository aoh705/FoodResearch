                "review_text": "Had the most incredible dining experience at Golden Wuish The Duckhouse in NYC. We started our evening with some unique and delicious drink. The Duck a Lorange, a Bulleit Bourbon-infused Peking Duck Fat Washed creation, was a definite winner. It set the tone for the night. For appetizers, we tried the Satay Beef Skewers   grilled beef skewers with turmeric garlic and lemongrass, served with a peanut butter sauce. The flavors were outstanding, and it was a great precursor to the main event. The Flaming Peking Duck stole the show. Perfected through generations, the duck was seasoned with a special blend of spices, dried for 8 hours, and then roasted to a crispy, golden brown perfection. Each bite was a celebration of Chinese culinary heritage, and we couldnt get enough. Moving on, the Wagyu Beef Dan Dan Noodles brought a spicy and rich Sichuan classic to our table. The Hot Stone-Seared Wagyu added a touch of theatricality   sizzling A5 Wagyu presented right in front of us. Our waiter Anthony was amazing. To cap off our culinary journey, we indulged in the Yum Cha Set, a delightful assortment of dim sum featuring pork, shrimp, fish, vegetable, and mushroom. Each bite was a burst of flavors, showcasing the culinary expertise of Golden Wuish. Leaving the restaurant, we couldnt help but feel grateful for the unforgettable evening. Golden Wuish The Duckhouse is more than just a dining spot; its an experience. If youre in the Financial District, dont miss the chance to savor authentic Chinese cuisine at its finest.",

                "review_text": "My husband I went here for our Xmas dinner. The host and staff was very friendly and welcoming. We started with non -alcoholic drinks the lechee drink and oolong moijto. Which was delicious and refreshing. I highly recommend the DIM SUM assorted platter. It was so good and beautifully presented. My husband got the beef platter which we asked for medium but came out rare. They fixed right away. I wanted the duck but they didn t sell half ducks on weekends. So I asked to take the bones home if I got whole duck which was $88 for whole duck. The waitress said yes so I ordered it. The flaming duck was cool to see the cutter sliced it up nicely. They served the duck 3 ways, roasted, smoked and in a soup. The duck was delicious, but the soup never came out so I asked for it to go. I also asked for the bones, the waiter then says it s an ADDITIONAL $10 for the bones?!!! Why did I pay $88 for whole duck. That annoyed me!  I felt like that was a scam!  Tell me in the beginning! It s very over price for the amount of duck you actually get, the soup also has tiny chucks of duck meat when I looked it at home. We also started off with sesame chicken small plate to share! The chicken was tender and not too sweet!! So good! Over all the service was friendly but tricky with additional charges and forgot my soup. The restaurant is super charming and cozy! Drinks were amazing and dim sum was delicious! Duck is over price for what you actually get. I say for for drinks and dim sum but the duck is good BUT for the price just know it will be smaller portion.",

Flaming duck is big - 3-4 people can eat this comfortably and with the price of 88$ it is pricey so you better share it - there is alot. Chicken appetizer is amazing and steak large plate is a bit too raw for me - mostly amazed by dim-sum and would come back for only that :)",

Yeh buddy, you go ahead and wait 3 hours for your dinner and then come back and tell me that s ok.  The three tables behind me all got their ducks before me and they all arrived after me.  It seems unless you order the whole duck, they just don t care.  There was no way that was even half a duck, looks like a quarter of duck and there were no drumstick or wing.  I went for pizza afterwards because I was still hungry.  Feel free to have Peking duck anywhere and not even Chinatown because you never have to wait an hour.  You can even get delivery and it won t be that long.",

Go for the whole peking duck experience where they roll the whole biped out on a trolley,  light it on fire and dispatch the bird in three ways (Peking duck wraps, smoked slices, and duck soup).  The wraps were paper things which were appreciated and included the typical condiments ie thinly sliced cucumbers, green onion, and hoisin sauce. The duck skin was crispy,  and the meat moist. The slices were placed on a decorative platter. The Yum Cha set dim sum sampler really brought back memories of my grandma. Besides pretty much every sample being delicious,  it was an emotional experience as well. We also ordered the wagyu beef Dan Dan noodle which had bouncy strands an overall medium spiciness to it. It was tasty, but the wagyu is diced small and therefore they are fully cooked throughout.  Not a bad thing served in this manner but I feel wagyu should always by had rare or at most, medium rare and in slices. We were so stuffed and skipped dessert. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely go back.",

We dined on a smorgashboard of everything. We started with the flaming peking duck experience. The duck was crispy and succulent. We tried it smoked, in wraps and soup. We shared a dim sum platter with an assortment of dumplings. We ordered The lamb chops, lobster and tofu, braised pork knuckle, lobster and tofu mapo, black truffle fried rice, and duck tacos. We ended the dinner by singing Happy Birthday to the Ole Gal. She had a chocolate cate and we tried the moon cake. We had so much food and I want to go back to try the dan dan noodles and the spicy prawn. This experience was a good time.",

Unfortunately, my experience fell short due to the server s inability to answer questions from the menu and the lack of attention from the staff regarding the quality of the food. The server appeared clueless when asked about ingredients and preparation. Additionally, no one bothered to approach our table to inquire about the food, ask if we needed anything. It felt as though we were left to fend for ourselves which significantly dampened the overall dining experience. We will never come back to this restaurant with pricey food and horrible service.",

Not only that but the nostalgic music full of 90s,early 2000s soothing remixes was just pleasant to listen to.",

The service is amazing and attentive. The presentation of the drinks and dishes are magical and make the experience even better. We got the Peking Duck experience which requires at least 2 hours advance notice. It is served tableside and is spectacular and tastes amazing. The duck is served 3 ways. We also had the duck nachos which were outstanding. I almost cried at the presentation of my smoked cocktail. Everything is so beautiful and delicious and served with such care.",

Admittedly, the texture on the Singapore noodles was good but they had no flavor at all. I couldnt even recognize the dish. The menu is nonsensical.

Everything was exquisitely prepared and delicious. The dining atmosphere was superb.

The happy hour dumplings were okay, but the truffle fried rice tasted bland as if the truffle was fake and the rice had been sitting outside for days. The water tasted like it had metal in it. The staff were friendly, but they mustve been new because the service was slow and kind of off. The waitress took 20 min to bring us water. When she did, she accidentally spilled water all over our table. It took another 20 min for her to move us to another table, even though there were a ton of open tables.",

The food was absolutely fanatic, 5 stars all around. The Peking duck was by far the best Ive ever had - we were fighting over pieces of crispy skin. So flavorful and wonderful! The roast boneless spare ribs with honey are an absolute must-order appetizer. Although the meat is served off the bone, you get everything youd expect (crispy, fatty, melty) from a traditional spare ribs. I made this gesture   after my first bite! Theyre quite different than Dads Spare Ribs, which we were also served. Dads come on the bone and are made with five spice to hit every type of taste, and were super juicy and fun to eat. If I had to choose between the two, though, Id go with honey roasted. The lamb chops with cumin had an excellent sear, and the crispy cumin and other aromatics really elevated the dish. Loved the flavors and the texture, some of the best lamb Ive ever been served. The signature dim sum was great, too. We loved the presentation and the sauces that came with it. It would be a great app to share or eat all for yourself. IMO, Wuish is a great place to go if youre trying to impress someone - I definitely was!",
