Ultimately it wasnt apparent that you would *need* to buy the sauce which was $2/ea for a tiny container (about a quarter cups worth) and that both items would be severely lackihg without the sauce. Given the price, the size, and the dryness we were pretty underwhelmed for an item we had been led to believe would be delicious. They should give the sauces with the items by default",

I got there 2 hours after opening and they were already out of the pernil, so I got the chicken as a consolation. They said it would be 10 minutes but it took 30. After waiting a half hour I received a small burrito filled with dry chicken and a minuscule amount of guacamole and cheese. Completely devoid of love and way overpriced for the amount of food. The classic phenomenon in NYC when a good thing gets super popular it loses its qualities that got it popular in the first place.",

They even charged me $2 for spicy sauce on the side. Ridiculous. 3: So slow. I cant blame the guy who worked there, as he had to handle the cooking and the preparing, and the cashier. I got my so-called burrito after 15-20 min. I guess there is a potential there, but it needs to be priced much lower for the size, and they need to step up with the ingredients. Good luck.",

When you hear the ingredients of the OG it might sound a little overwhelming or a little like  do those things belong together?! Let me assure you they most definitely do. A beautiful fusion of Asian and Hispanic staples with such complimentary flavors I was truly floored. The pernil and scallion pancake do make it a tad on the greasy side but a little grease never hurt nobody   My only complaint about Forsyth is they should have a true flagship with more convenient hours so we can indulge more often! I will definitely go out of my way tho when I m in the city to partake of that burrito whenever I have the chance.",

The burrito was nice but the ratios of meat to sauce etc was a bit off. The meat itself was a mix of quite dry pork with very fatty skin etc, I would have maybe rather the fat was chopped a bit finer? But that s personal preference. It ends up being very salty and oily, and it s a shame because the lemongrass chili oil was really good. The scallion pancake could taste more of scallion to be honest, but was nice. Would be a lot better if they put more sauce and guacamole on the burrito.",

However, I wonder if the burrito might have been better during a lunch rush when the food was more fresh? The meat was sitting on the flat top grill and looked like it had been there for a while. I m also not sure how fresh the <scallion> pancake was and since there were no visible scallions in the pancake..I guess it was just a pancake. As other reviewers wrote, it was super greasy, but I don t mind grease/oily food as long as it s fresh and delicious which this was not sadly. Kind of disappointing. If you re going to go, I d recommend a time when it s a little bit busy. The people were very nice, but like also seemed bored. I d be bored too bc there s nothing to do. I m not even sure how many people work there bc when I got to the counter there was just one dude taking orders. Then I walked around and came back and asked if my food was ready, he said no, then I saw another dude walk behind the counter so I guess that was the dude who actually cooks the food? Unclear.  But ya, wanted to like it, didn t, recommend going at a time when you can make sure you get something freshly made. Also perhaps it s just not as good as it once was on the fire escape? That happens. Oh well. Sad, but maybe inevitable.",

                "review_text": "Interesting, but far away, overhyped, and perhaps overpriced. I happened to be on the far west part of the city and got to finally try this scallion burrito I saw online elsewhere. I visited this spot inside of the Olly Olly Market (which itself isnt super easy to spot the 26th street entrance.)  There was no line when I was there midday around 1pm on a Thursday. Location and maybe price may have a bit to do with that.  It was $14, but that isnt much more than a burrito from Dos Toros these days. They try to upsell you on the sauces to get sides of them, but no thanks, since it says it comes with the sauce already in the description. I got it and took it to eat on the way out. Overall, Id agree with others that is a bit too salty.  The lemongrass sauce definitely was in there, but just in one little pocket.  It was tasty. They probably should just put more on there for the price you pay. I honestly appreciate the scallion pancake, but I dont think it adds enough flavor or texture that Id pay a premium to go here over Dos Toros. I appreciate the invention, but hopefully they are cooking up some new tricks to keep people coming back to this distant part of the city.",

It was difficult to get through towards the end because of how dry and salty it was. The filling also had a bit of cheese and maybe (?) guac but not enough to make a difference... The scallion pancake fell flat. There was no flakiness or layering. I could barely taste the scallions, and it was incredibly oily. Overall, just a poor representation of what a scallion pancake should be. Maybe it would have tasted better with the sauce, but since they wanted to charge extra for it, I expected the burrito to be able to stand on its own. It did not. Unfortunately, overhyped and overpriced. Interesting concept but lackluster execution  because of this, I wouldn t recommend.",
