I had visited other spots in the area before like Wo Hop, Wah Fung, and some others so I had high expectations when many people said this spot was just as good if not better. We decided to get the dish most suggested to us (the wheat peanut butter noodles) and then also added one we really wanted to try (the pork and chive dumplings).  The woman at the counter was very friendly and spoke good English (which in some spots is surpringly an issue).  For the two dishes and two cans of soda it was only $9! The peanut butter noodles were unlike anything I ve had before.  They did not have a Thai peanut taste really (which is what I was expecting) but they didn t exactly just taste like peanut butter either.  I enjoyed the sauce a great deal.  The noodles also were a great texture.  They were similar to a thin egg noodle but they had longer length similar to any long style pasta like spaghetti or fettuccine.  I would absolutely order these again, and trust when I say that my next trip to Chinatown will have these included. The steamed pork and chive dumplings were also a huge hit.  The filling had excellent flavor, a nice texture to the outer skin, and after you added a little chili oil there were was a lot of dimensions of flavor.  I enjoyed these a lot and I think I d enjoy them just as much if they were pan fried so half had a crust to them.  We had dumplings at other spots on this day and these were my favorite of them all.

Had the noodles in peanut sauce, fishball soup and pork/chives dumplings. Noodles had a great texture which I really enjoyed even though Im not a big fan on such flat noodles. Peanut sauce had some good flavour to it but needed a little extra vinegar and chilli oil (which are readily available together with sriracha). Soup was just a plain soup with slight flavouring probably from the fishballs and abit of salt/msg. Fishballs were good but not fantastic. Got a nice bite to it and flavourful enough. Theyre a Fuzhou specialty with meat in it so when you bite into them, the meat juices spurts out which is pretty enjoyable. Best dish has got to be the dumplings. Really tasty and I just couldnt get enough of them. Skin was smooth and the meat filling was just delicious.

I got an order of the noodles with peanut sauce and a small fish ball soup. The noodles were chewy and the sauce was peanutty and flavorful, awesome! I just wish they had some chili oil for me to add to it; it would have been the perfect combination. The fish balls were quite good as well, though the meat inside wasnt very flavorful. The fish ball outside was quite chewy though not as soft as I thought it would be. The soup it came with was really good too, especially after I added the white pepper. For $2 each (including tax, and since you pay first you dont need to pay tip), the noodles and the fish ball soup are definitely a great bargain! I also tried my friends steamed dumplings which were also good (the soy sauce they have there isnt strictly soy sauce and its really delicious - I want to find out what it is!). The skin was a bit thick, though it was quite chewy. Very simple meal, but quite satisfying and tasty! Downside is everything here is plastic :( [Edit Dec 4, 2021] Havent been here for ages and mostly forgot about it, but its great! Changed location and upgraded the inside, its no longer dingy and falling apart - theres now proper tables and chairs and lighting, much cleaner feeling too. Surprisingly, prices havent raised at all in the last two (or more) years, no idea how! My go-to is the large pork and cabbage dumplings which comes with ten pieces along with the peanut butter noodles. Cash only, $6.75 including tax for it all, amazing! The only downside of this place is the excessive use of plastic, which is actually what shu jiao in the name of the restaurant is.

Now the filling, this was tasty. They were more heavy handed on the chives which prefer. The dumplings come out steaming hot and just a very small sip of porky juice. It has a nice blend of the chives and pork but there is this subtle sweetness that hints you just as you swallow. They are cheap as ever and a large serving of 10 would fill you up. There isnt any chili oil here but rather sriracha, soy sauce and black vinegar. You dont really need anything else to top the dumplings because they are flavored very well. The pork ball broth reminds me more of pork wontons with barely there skin. The broth has subtle fish flavor and tartness. I suspect that there is some vinegar.

It was served in a plastic take-out container. One time, I walked here to check it out given its great reviews and the girl I was with was like, no. And I think she had it right.

They ll probably tell you to go to Vanessa s. on Eldridge Street. If things are really dire, they might even send you to the 14th Street location, or the one on Bedford Avenue. But here s the truth: Vanessa s Dumplings is kind of bad. They re not bad, say if you re at a strip mall in Connecticut. But they re thick and often greasy, and more importantly, all you need to do is walk about 20 steps to have what might be the best dumplings in Manhattan. On the corner of Broome and Eldridge, about a quarter block up from Vanessa s, is Shu Jiao Fu Zhou, a spot you could easily walk by without noticing - no less going in. Don t make that mistake. For $2, you can get 6 perfectly steamed, smooth, truly delightful dumplings with a pork filling that is almost sweet. They don t come fried, and if you can t deal with that, you don t really deserve to be here anyway.
