Following a brief search, we decided on Nepali Bhancha Ghar - a five time five time winner of the annual momo crawl. Planning to spend a large part of our day eating we decided to split a single dish and a mango lassi each. After some consultation we opted for a beef jhol momo and enjoyed the calming music playing in the background. Lassi s were first to arrive, adequately priced at 4 dollars, and consisting of a tasty combination of salty yogurt and sweet mango. Momo s arrived soon after, floating in a delightfully aromatic broth and topped with coriander. We dug in, dipping the momos in the broth before biting into them, and were rewarded with a delicious texture and a fresh, warm and delicately spiced filling. The broth was equally tasty, with hints of acidity and additional freshness from coriander. Whilst we only tried out a singular item, we were both very impressed with our experience, and given the opportunity, I would happily revisit to try out the rest of Nepali Bhancha Ghar s presumably impressive menu.",11 months ago,2023-05-24 15:25:44.156077,,,,0,44,97,True,,

Chicken chow mein ended up being chicken lo mein. The noodles were fully incorrectly presented vs. Their picture and the title itself. The chicken was overcooked, HARD, and BURNT on the sides.

I came here twice last year, the first time, we came in, sat down (4 of us) ordered our food. after 45 minutes, our food was not prepared and we waited. Finally our friend who spoke Nepali said that the 2 workers were arguing about who was supposed to start cooking. When the food arrived, it was actually amazing. The momos were great, the chicken thukpa was great, the cold ramen looking dish (forgot what its called) was great. So waiting almost an hour wasnt bad because the quality was amazing. 2nd time, we came and sat. We ordered momos and the cold ramen dish thing. Food came quicker, but was not as good. The momos were grainy at some parts and felt undercooked, I couldnt eat the rest after a while because i started to have a gag reflex. The language barrier for us was bad because it was hard to communicate with the staff because we dont speak Nepali. Now that brings us to today. We placed a large order through seamless, vegetable fried rice no egg, momos, 3 chicken thukpas, 1 vege thukpa and a few other dishes. Our coworker accidentally order thentuk instead of thukpa, but thats fine. The issue was how they sent the food to us. Everything was tighlty packed and in several bags. Meaning 4 soup containers, on top of one another, each was boiling hot in plastic containers which are definitely not meant for this type of heat. When we got our food, 3 of the 4 soup containers were broken, Broth was everywhere in the bag. The chicken Thali was bad, the pieces were very small, contained bone and were not edible for the most part. The sauce from that container also spilled into the bag. The lentil sauce also spilled into the bags as well. The fried rice wasnt tasty nor was the vegetable soup. I have to say, myself along with my coworkers were disappointed and will probably not order from again in the near future. They didnt package the items properly. It wasnt the fault of the delivery person, as they had everything in a cooler. Seeing as how the previous 2 experiences were, I can only fault the restaurant.",3 years ago,2021-04-24 15:26:03.727162,,,,0,61,3,False,,

I randomly stumbled upon this restaurant about 5 years back, when it was literally just a hole in the wall spot on a side street, nestled between a barber shop and a meat store. I wouldnt have even known about it if it wasnt for the wonderful aroma of the food. I generally have a rule that if the food smells good at a restaurant, you should at least try one item, or that particular item that they are cooking that you smelled. I dont remember what the first thing I ordered here, but simply put, I was completely blown away. The old lady owner of the place (referred simply as Didi) was hand making dumplings (which later I learned are Momos), and was very enthusiastic about me being there for the first time, and suggested a myriad of items to try. I only tried a few, but shouldve taken her advice! If youve never had it, Nepalese food is similar to Indian food, but its also vastly different, unique, and full of big robust flavors. Theres a few things I love about this place. First of all, they do not try to Americanize their cuisine, and tone down the spice or flavors. This means that some items will def have some spice and heat, but its never overwhelming, and not everything is spicy. Second, the portions are really good, and you will be full quite easily and affordably. This is local working people food, so the price is very reasonable, and the quantity is supple. Lastly, I dont eat any pork  and this place also doesnt cook any pork products, and their meat is halal! If you are coming here for the first time, I suggest you start with a few sel rotis (deep fried rice flour rings with a spicy salsa like sauce), some selection of Momos (go for the jhol Momo which bathes in a spicy broth), choyela, and any other items you may want to try. My favorite is beef shkuti, which are dry beef pieces that are cooked on a wok with several spices, and the flavors build the more you chew. If you are really hungry, go for one of their signature Thalis, which are several vegetable items, Daal, rice, pickles, some type of green veg, and meat/fish item of your choosing. Even if you are not a vegetarian, getting the veggie thali may just end up converting you, as youll see how much flavor can be packed into simple vegetables. Bhanchaa Ghar is a special place. A few years ago some friends and I did a Momo crawl in Jackson heights, touring and tasting all the Momos from all the surrounding restaurants. Needless to say, this place won, and no surprise there. Their food is a flavor explosion in your mouth, and regardless of the spice and flavors, you will happily indulge in all the foods. I make a trip here from Brooklyn frequently, just to eat at this spot. If youre in Queens, definitely stop by here and try the food.

Before all that though, I was a little confused, entering the restaurant. It was smaller than what I had envisioned from photographs, and there was no counter, so to speak. I just kind of helplessly looked over the wall and caught the eye of a lady cooking, asking where I should order. And right then and there, she asked me back,  What do you want to order?   Sel roti and jhol momo, please. At my request to eat in, she asked if I preferred the tables here at ground level (which were pretty tight) or the basement down the stairs. Dang, basement? I didn t know what to expect, but that s what I chose. She waved me off after I had ordered, and I assumed I just had to wait downstairs. The stairs are creaky and narrow, and they lead down to a much more spacious area. It was actually quite nice and bright, with photos of and trinkets from Nepal scattered on the walls. It was just before noon, and I saw people hunched in chairs, waiting for their meals to arrive. I chose a table and maybe 5 minutes later, the lady from above came and served me piping hot jhol momo and warm sel roti. When I first read about sel roti s description, the rice flour interested me. And when I finally bit into it, warm, soft, and crunchy from the rice flour, slightly sweet, I was pleasantly surprised. This was bread in a way I hadn t really experienced before. I had no expectations coming in, so maybe I m hyping it up too much. But that sel roti with its soft and crunchy combo and subtle sweetness accompanied the spicy jhol momo so well. I didn t know what to do with my dishes when I was done, so I waited to see what others would do once they left the basement. Apparently, you just leave them at your table and then head back upstairs, and then try to motion to her that you d like to pay. She was pretty good at remembering everyone s orders in line, and she was very proud to say that she won the Momo Crawl for two years in a row. Overall, great experience at Bhanchha Ghar. =) Jhol momo: spicy and fragrant pretty large portions.

That said, you pay quite a lot considering this is a real hole in the wall. The ground floor is a hole in the wall in the charming sort of way, but seating is very limited. The basement is a hole in the wall in the kinda unpleasant sort of way, but there is a lot of seating. Wai Wai sandheko ($6 for small): Dry instant noodles diced and tossed with fresh peppers and spices. Tasty. Beef jhol momo ($9): Loved the rich flavor of the chutney and the way it worked with the momo submerged in it. Chicken choila ($11): At first, I was a bit disappointed with the flavor of this seasoned chicken borderline jerky. However, as I continued to eat it I found it more and more addictive and hard to put down, and I was quite happy with it by the end. They also gave us a sel roti, which was really nice of them.
