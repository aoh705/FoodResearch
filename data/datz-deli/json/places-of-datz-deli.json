Its in a run down location 2. Extremely small space ,only one girl working there moving very slow , 3. Extremely long wait 4. Way too over price 5. Food is bland . I came all the way from Suffolk county because of the social media hype. Unfortunately my first and last visit . The long lines is not because food is tasty or extravagant ,is because theyre moving slow paced",

From the moment I took my first bite, I knew I was in for a treat ! The oxtail was cooked to perfectly with the meat so tender it practically melted in my mouth. The flavors were rich and savory, with a depth that can only come from slow-cooking but the beef patty is the heart of what holds this beautiful concoction together. The curry goat MORE equally impressive( Called the Drake) The meat was incredibly tender, and the curry sauce had just the right amount of heat and spice was so savory ( best I will get the dish with rice and peas) !!!The flavors were well-balanced, also combined with Max & Cheese and sauce that had a perfect blend of aromatic spices that created a joy for my mouth! I m short I loved both patty sandwiches but the curry goat was my favorite and next time I can do it with just cheese and no Mac and cheese ! I love the touch of the sweet plantain on the top and that the store is full of different/imported chips , snacks and drinks ; making even more unique of a deli !",

The Oxtail Datmacpatty is a great concept, but needs some work. It was definitely lacking seasoning & sauce. There were several other options on the menu, but we only tried the Datmacpatty & the fish. The fish could ve been better. Definitely needed more seasoning & was probably cooked too long because the inside wasn t fluffy. Very dry in my opinion. However, The owners/staff were friendly. Great experience. Would I recommend? I Definitely would recommend everyone to try it, but it wasn t worth the hype in my opinion. People must like it because they had a long line of customers, but they were able to get customers in and out quickly, which is a plus in my book.",

As a Guyanese, I think some can agree we cook with heavy seasoning, salt, pepper, etc. DatzDeli should create a pepper sauce for those who like spicy to have it on the side. That way for others that dont like spicy, they can still be able to eat something. I think now theyre more out there, based on the reviews.. Quality is becoming an issue. These patties were over $30.. I love the story. If you also know some people dont like to get into business with their family. They are beating the odds. Id love to support this business some more.

We recently tried the DatMacPatty, a veggie patty bursting with the delightful combination of warm mac and cheese, spinach, and cheese, all enveloped in a soft coco bread   a true flavor explosion that exceeded our expectations! Additionally, the Drake DatMacPatty, featuring goat curry and baked mac and cheese encased in a Caribbean-styled beef patty, was a taste sensation like no other. The choice of warm cocoa bread elevated the experience, making it a must-try for anyone seeking a unique and delicious dining adventure. The ambiance was welcoming, and the staff provided excellent service. Datz Deli has certainly carved its niche in bringing innovative and mouthwatering Caribbean-inspired dishes to Queens. We cant wait to return for more culinary adventures at this fantastic location!",

Ox tail mac and cheese beef patty on a coconut roll with ox juice on top. Great idea. Very messy. The guy did give a lot of napkins though without me even asking which is always nice and definitely necessary in this case! In theory it s a great sandwich. In reality it was 3 stars. Nothing to write home about. Or maybe that was just a bad day. Who knows?  They also have lots of interesting exotic snacks from different countries around the world. And even some interesting variations of American snacks that you definitely don t see everywhere.",

I have been a patron of your establishment for quite some time now, and I must say that your variety of patties never fails to impress me. The extensive selection ensures that there is something for everyone, and the quality of the food is truly outstanding. In particular, I wanted to highlight the oxtail patty as a personal favorite. The harmonious blend of flavors is truly impressive, and despite my initial skepticism, the combination works remarkably well. I find the marriage of flavors to be a delightful surprise each time I enjoy this patty. Additionally, I must commend you guys Caribbean Mac and cheese. While I am typically not a fan, I have found that it surprisingly complements the patties most of the time. The flavors work together splendidly, further enhancing the overall dining experience. Furthermore, I appreciate the effort you put into providing a diverse range of imported snacks from around the world. This inclusion adds to the overall appeal of your establishment, and it sets you apart from other  delis  in the area.

We flew in from far away just to try it and I d gladly do it again. Drink, chip and snack section pairs well with any sandwich. I didn t catch the name of the young lady at the register but wanted to thank her for having such an amazing spirit and patience. Great customer service.",

Very little oxtail meat, which is normal these days, with three chunks of fat on my patty, that I thought were pieces of meat until I put it into my mouth. I will not buy it again, but the curry chicken patty was hitting. The flavor was there the chicken well seasoned and marinated, and I have no complaints about this patty. If I had to recommend an item, it would definitely be the curry chicken Mac patty. This restaurant could definitely keep their work space cleaner as well. I came in the evening after 7pm and the temperature holding counter were food is kept, was very messy. I traveled a far distance to get to this restaurant. It s not worth me making the trip, I came all the way from downtown Brooklyn, but if you live in the area or close by, it s worth trying out.",

The patties are made with fresh, high-quality ingredients and are seasoned to perfection. The crust is flaky and buttery, and the filling is juicy and flavorful. I first tried DatzDeli at the San Gennaro Festival. I was immediately hooked on the delicious flavor and texture of the patties.  Ive tried many beef patties, but none in NYC  have compared to DatzDeli. The patties at DatzDeli are best enjoyed hot and fresh.",

Do they wait until the food actually runs out before remaking a dish out of order? Told inaccurate wait time when I pre-pay. And orders given ahead of me and others despite us waiting longer.  No more. This area is loaded with caribbean joints. Hate to write a poor review on a family owned place but everything I said is 100% true. Not worth it.",

They put the beef patty in a butter flap, not coco bread The oxtail mac patty they just dish out whats in the oxtail tray so youre getting carrots in there as well which was weird to eat in a beef patty. Also, they dont really shred the oxtail so you might get some meat and some fatty pieces also. The noodles in the mac n cheese was overcooked and it did nothing to enhance the flavor. I feel like if it was slightly undercooked and they used the top part of the mac like the burnt cheese when you broil it, that would definitely slap. I had the jerk chicken mac patty also and in my opinion, that one was way better. Mac n cheese still threw me off. Overall, it was alright. A bit overhyped though. I was expecting an explosion of flavors especially at that price point but I did not experience that. Their juices were pretty good. All the food is halal so that was a plus for me. Might come back and try other things.",

The cashier was patient with people and read my order back. The food traveled well as I waited 30 minutes after to eat. I got a Datz Mac Patty with oxtail and no American cheese. I wasnt sure I would like the coco bread with all the extra ingredients but the sweetness really mellows it out. Im officially a fan and understand the hype of this place. Its nothing complicated but theyre taking a few ingredients and combining them in a way that mends! Definitely give Datz Deli a try! I see people leaving 4 star reviews because the line and how busy it gets. Well, you know they went viral and have many fans looking to try. Ratings should be based off food, customer service, and price. When a line is long you cant expect to be in and out. When the line is short, theyre quick. Wait time once you order is around 5 to 10 minutes. Very reasonable. If lines are an issue for you I recommend going during your lunch break on a weekday as the crowd is very light. I was in and out within 10 to 15 minutes.",

The curry shrimp patties were delicious also. All patties come with coco bread, and are cut in half for easy handling. PROS>>> Delicious beef patty infusions! The staff was very friendly, and they sold various other snack foods not found in local stores. CONS>>> Location is small. Due to the constant stream of new and repeat customers, the waiting area gets cramped pretty quick. If possible, I would order ahead. Other than that, I would absolutely visit again!",

                "review_text": "NOT Your everyday sandwich . You need to try this if you like meat patties. Dat Mac Patty is blowing up at this Gyanese deli in Holis Hills Queens.  @datzdeli190 Theyve  been open for about 6 months and their Dat mac patty has gone viral! A meat patty sliced open, layered with american cheese,  lump of mac and cheese and your choice of oxtail,  chicken, or curried goat. Wrapped up with love into a coco bread and topped with mooore sauce. The oxtail is the most popular and they dish out about 300 a day! The oxtail dish is a family recipie Man, this is one great invention! Layers of incredible flavor  the fall of the bone slow cooked meat, cheese and the coco bread. Damn! Go say hi to the Datz Deli Fam and get a Dat Mac Patty inspired by their childhood food. This sandwich was inspired by the meat patries stuffed with pepporoni and mozzarella sticks in local pizza shops when they were kids. The folks here were super friendly. Brothers Josh and Bobby are awesome. Adele at the register greets you with a great smile and patiently navigates  the ever growing line of folks waiting for the oxtail to be ready. They dont serve it until the meat is falling off the bone. They make everything in-house or in their bakery.",

Its truly a delicate blend of heaven for the soul, a must try even if you have to sometimes wait in line...it will be worth the wait. I would also recommend Curry Chicken with Peas and Rice along with some warm Cocoa Bread.",

This is a gem in the community! **This time upon returning I was able to enter this familys owned deli. The owners seem genuinely friendly & concerned with the customers enjoyment. Theres a wait time due to the fame of this menu and I can attest that the food is very favorable! Due to how busy this place is the food is also extremely fresh & doesnt last long.

If possible, it would be more enjoyable if the worker at the cash register provided clear information as to where to form a line outside and got to the point when making speeches outside. She vented a lot about her long day and the heat, though we already knew about the long day and the heat, because we were standing outside for an hour  After going off topic about the weather, she was asked about when we would be able to order, she replied sarcastically that she was about to get to that and does this all day and to give her a second Long lines and waiting outside are expected for a small space. Relating to customers and speaking to them while considering the long line and relaying relevant information are all soft skills. We got there at 5pm and waited outside until 6pm to be allowed back inside to order. She came outside twice to talk about her long day and the weather along with minor updates about how she still is waiting on oxtail.  Even though not everyone in line actually wanted to order oxtail, we all had to wait together. No one complained, everyone just waited patiently. Maybe next time, all of those who are waiting to order oxtail can wait outside and those who are ordering what is in full stock can stay due to lack of space, and we can provide an update in about 15 minutes? Something like that is very helpful for happy customers who just wanted to patronize a local business and enjoy time with their loved ones along the way. Feel free to reach out if you d like any efficiencies analyses with your business as we provide feedback often to owners, though typically in person. All in all, thank you for the food.",

The customer service is atrocious, they are slow ( the wait time for two poison patties was at least 40 mins!) As were standing there watching this man cut up some, I wanna say kraft cheese, you know that plastic garbage, 2 more employees finally arrive, only to go behind the counter and immediately grab a pair of gloves to start touching food. I had to say something so I ask,  are youll not going to wash your hands? They go, oh yeah, take the gloves off, wash their hands, and put the same gloves on! I was mortified and completely appalled! I have no idea how this place is still open for business. They use a toaster oven, so they cant toast the cocobread for each poison pattie, they had bugs amd nats galore flying around, with a big open bowl of Mac and cheese that they were just having a feast on..

There s too much promotion and hype around this restaurant. The restaurant cannot support  due to its small confinements and lack of additional ovens. I waited on the line for over two hours outside , then it started pouring so they decided to let everybody inside. The hostess or staff that was given time estimates was giving in correct time estimates and we ended up waiting more time because the patties were sold out by the time we got to the door. While inside the store and placing our orders, we still had to wait due to only one person making patties for the entire restaurant. That was very inefficient And made the process even longer than it had to be. Also, the person making patties was not changing gloves and was cross contaminating chicken, shrimp, beef, etc. luckily I am a person that is not allergic to anything so I didn t mind personally, but anybody else was a vegetarian, would have been annoyed if they saw that, I blame TikTok and Instagram for the over hype of this restaurant and I hope the restaurant gets it together as far as meeting the demand of the people who are willing to wait over two hours for some patties. Despite that two hours and a half later and 40 some odd dollars spent while wasting gas to get there. I m not impressed. They got me one time because of the promotion but I assure you this is a one and done.",

When I brought up the fact that it was highly unfair that people who wasn t in line first got served before everyone else I was brushed off and was told they did not skip which  indeed they did. When I asked how much longer it would take for our food i was being told 20 more mins and to be patient with the staff but it was actually a longer wait for the patties to finish .A total of 2 and a half hour wait for our food and $54 later (the two oxtail beef Pattie s I got and gas money ) I am highly disappointed in the service very unprofessional and lacks communication to the customers. very unsatisfied with my oxtail beef patty only 2 chopped up pieces of oxtail more Mac and cheese then anything . definitely will not come again not worth the commute or the product . 2/10.",

The burgeoning  demand of his signature beef pattie amalgameted with Mac & Cheese attributes to his ingenuity. Your bake and Salt fish was the catalyst and cornerstone to your business developing recognition and becoming ubiquitous to food lovers  as it is truly deserving of . You are all industrious as your anecdote behind the business coming to frution is inspirational . As a fellow Guyanese cooking isnt drudgery as some might perceive it to be . Guyanese cuisine is infused with an array of spices. Growing up in Georgetown I enjoyed true Guyanese cuisine from fresh greens to fresh caught fish . I was so fortunate to enjoy my grandmothers cooking which phenomenal and left me with an insatiable desire as I know your Dads cooking is and he gets to share it with the world. Kudos to his father Bobby for supporting and fortifying his sons vision and by dedicating his aptitude to cook food rich in history and culture. The energy and creativity and craft to understanding the bliss point in food as well what you are cooking to enjoy is imperative and Datz Deli have captured that . Datz Deli is a beacon for foodies aiming to delight their taste buds with palatable ambiance of Euphoria. Thank you Josh and Family . You are appreciated. Best regards  , Orin .",

Oh and if ur a diabetic and ur blood sugar is down go for it with unsweetened seltzer water or just plain cold water either way it was very delicious I personally wont eat this for a very long long time but on the serious note the hype is  very real",

Once we got in we were told that it would take 10-20 min food but ended up being ready in more than an hour for 5 sandwiches. The most irritating thing was their menu said $6 for their datmacpatty. But thinking I was gonna pay a certain amount ended up paying 60+ for barely any oxtail and bland tasting food. Don t waste your money here at all it s terribly not worth it. And tbh everyone saying it was delicious is lying bc they were paid or they bland taste as well.",

I tried it for the first time and have to say with cocoa bread is good but without cocoa bread was a lot better. Wish they had given me extra gravy for the one with cocoa bread because that was kinda dry and second there wasn t enough oxtail meat. I actually thought they forgot to give me oxtail but when i fully opened it there was some in the back. I was expecting way more for $12 per patty. Other than that i like that everything is made from scratch. Fresh handmade patties. Mac was good. Oxtail had good flavor and spices. The only other con was the wait time. I expected maybe a 30min wait but even after getting in the door and ordering it took another 20-30mins. Is it worth the wait  i leave it up to everyone to experience it on their own.",

The staff was super nice and I would not come here again for the signature patty, but I would come again for the curry shrimp and rice. I couldnt taste the patty at all, it tasted like a dry sandwich.",

The beef patty alone honestly was great. I had a piece of fish as well which was good. They have exclusive snacks which is cool but this review is specifically for the sandwich long wait, costly and it s mediocre in my opinion.",

When I finally was able to order I was told that they were out of Mac, said it would be right up. Then the mom who worked register said it would be 20 mins after already waiting 40 mins I said I m okay that time it too long can I get it without mac I was told that if you want but it s the same price. The son is only one cooking I heard him mention that they were running low on Mac and cheese but no one really assisted. After all that the cashier who was also the mom was really nonchalant about how long waited. I said that 20 more minutes was too long for me to wait. And her response verbatim was  no it s not we went viral . Shameful that the validation of social media was more important than a customer who was waiting almost an hour to support. I will never go back and hopefully this review is an eye opener on how you should treat customers.",

Everything looked fresh & smelled delicious! I waited 3 hours and it was worth it!! I got to see how dedicated this family is with Jennifer checking out customers, Josh making the sandwiches and updating us on the wait time, Bobby and their dad in the kitchen. Yes I know the names because they all told me their names! When I got to order they was out of the  drake  but I got the Kendra and a wide variety of snacks! Little by little as people were coming back from being told the wait time for the fresh batch of food there was already a line forming. I got to see it all be prepped in front of my face and the minute I took a bit of this sandwich It was unlike any other. This family business will be booming! Make sure to be ready to wait in line!!! The prices is great as well!!!",

Best beef patty is the best  I ever had. The oxtail wasn t ready but on my list on my next visit. The service is excellent and the people are so nice and humble. Friendly and makes you feel like family and are so welcoming. Great food. I will be going many more times and I cannot wait to get every single dish and the beef patty going forward.",

While, I wouldnt say its THE BEST sandwich in NYC, i would say its definately in my top 5. I had their signature oxtail macpatty, and it was delicious! The oxtail was tender, juicy, flavorful, and generous with the portions. You need a fork to eat the sandwich! The mac and cheese was savory and cooked to perfection, The cocoa bun was soft and flaky, soaking up every last bit of that oxtail gravy. I also partnered my sandwich with some one of a kind chips and drink, that i have not seen anywhere else.  The Biggie Smallz chips were meh, but the Jamaican root beer was excellent. All in all, give Datz Deli-Manhattan a visit for this genuine Killa Queens culinary experience.",

Nobody will ever understand just how amazing their food is, how the technique, the ingredients and the presentation just comes together and I ve been there 3 times now and the quality is always consistent. Super worth the commute from Brooklyn and I am just looking forward to the day where Datz Deli expands to more areas. If you got the time to go either location, plz do so because the vibe is always great and it s just an amazing experience to watch how they make the Patties. Just a huge shoutout to the Datz Deli fam for blessing us with their presence and their food!!!",

Honestly I was hoping for excitement in flavor and to have a Caribbean feeling and taste and to be honest there was no flavor and I believe they are a little gasp up. The food is overhype and I would prefer a regular beef patty with coco bread and cheese at a regular Caribbean spot. I didn t enjoy it and I was sadly disappointed. I was hoping due to their following on social medias and their videos on people waiting in line and how they make it, it s really not that good at all. If you prefer taste, I don t recommend this place at all. If you want to try it out you can try it out some people might like that but it s overhyped. And for 12 dollars it s not worth it either. The workers were there were nice but I believe this gotta be a NY thing. If you do go there, good luck trying it!",
