Came to the area because my friend was craving a chicken parm sandwich and this place had good reviews for Yelp. I expected to see a little shop with seating and tables, but this place looked as casual as can be. Due to the pandemic, the only way to order is via window where the cashier opens and closes to take your order. They do have options to order online via the food delivery services (Seamless/GrubHub) and also in person ordering (which they give you a number written on a post it). They accept both card and cash. Luckily they do have a bench around the corner of their shop which is where my friend me I enjoyed our sandwiches and appetizers. I ordered the  Off the Boat  panini (prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, arugula, and sun dried tomatoes) with a side of mozzarella sticks. My friend ordered the FDNY hero (chicken cutlet, vodka sauce, fresh mozzarella on garlic bread) with a side of sweet potato fries. We did the switcheroo with half our sandwiches just to get the balance. I loved my panini sandwich, eating it without feeling guilty, and with the filling to bread ratio just to my liking (I am normally not a bread person). The saltiness of the prosciutto was balanced nicely with the sweetness of the sun dried tomatoes, and the crunch of the arugula and bread, with the softness of the cheese provided a perfect envelope of flavors into each bite. Normally I am not a crazy arugula fan due to its slight bitterness in nature, but because of the cheese and the other ingredients, you can hardly taste the bitterness. The mozzarella sticks were huge, and fresh, with each bite having the stretch that I loved playing with. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the marinara sauce because it was too thin and watery. I have always preferred my sauce with little more substance and thickness. The FDNY sandwich for me was a little dry for me, as there was not much sauce in the sandwich. Also, there was a little too much bread for me. The sweet potato fries were good, and I did not expect anything less. In the Brooklyn area, towards Williamsburg? Craving a sandwich worth your money?

That had to be one of the best sandwiches Ive had in a long time, and I look forward to my next experience!
