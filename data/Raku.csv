I immediately get transported to a hole in the wall noodle shop in Kyoto that is playing lofi bangers that Shazam cant pick up. Deep cuts only. I came here alone on my lunch break today as on a cold rainy day, my heart, mind, and soul immediately go to a Raku meal. This is a fantastic place for a solo meal to just come and enjoy your own company... while we are on the topic I get so annoyed when people be posting about how they are going on solo meals. Like cant you just go do that and not post about it? Was it really a solo meal if you gotta tell everyone about it?..... Well I guess Im doing that now just in Yelp form ahahaha damn. The Niku Udons spice level is just enough to make your nostrils run and let out one of those quick little woooo breaths out of your mouth, which is my idyllic spice level. The voluminous bowl, which consists of a light flavorful broth, silk noodles, beef short-rib, nori sansho chili oil, tendon, and honeycomb tripe is my hangover cure. Well that and a couple puffs of a pre-roll but thats neither here nor there. I let out an audible wow on my final sip of the broth, as my soul needed it. My soul been hella tired lately idk why. My only complaint is that $27 before tax and tip is just steep. It cant be a weekly occurrence for me, as much as I would like it to. Once a quarter vibes smh.

In the middle of dinner the two waiters disappeared ((already not enough, and very hard to grab), and were nowhere to be found for several minutes. Zero service. Clients completely abandoned and perplexed. Our waitress in particular obviously hates her job, and was there against her will, judging by the way she treated us and others, including spilling a drink on another client because she wanted to rush cleanup. We had to beg for water. Their main goal was removing dishes and glasses, whether you were finished or not. Last call includes drinks, so god forbid you re still eating a dish you ordered and paid for and need something else to drink. You can die of thirst and they ll make sure to tell you in a very rude manner. To top it off, when you pay the bill you re offered the options of tipping 20% to 30%, no other choices, especially tipping less. Bottom line? Great food. Would I go back. Never.

The tempura also comes with an umeboshi which was really refreshing. I normally don t like pickled plum, but it was so yummy. And the interior design/vibe was clean and chic (but traditional). I had a mid-afternoon reservation and was sad to find that there was no more matcha for dessert. The waiter recommended a sesame-apricot dessert that was surprisingly good! I wouldn t have thought the two flavors would go so well together, but it was creative and sweet. My only con was the hostess. My reservation was for a larger party but, due to certain circumstances, the party size became somewhat smaller. After we were seated, she had asked why the other members had to cancel? The question and the comments afterward were probably not meant to be rude, but it was received as a hurtful probe that, as a hostess, shouldn t have been questioned or said.

We were led to a 6-person table and sat between two other couples- the lack of space/ partitions made both of us immediately uneasy and I wish the option to wait for table seating was offered. Nonetheless, we came here for the famed udon.. that ended up coming after over 20 minutes of waiting. The couple who were sat next to us at the same time literally got their food, finished, and left before either of us got our food. I understand its busy but that was no excuse for the service. My partner had his udon almost slammed down on the table wordlessly. When it came time to pay, the server stared over his shoulder as he input the tip and signed, which I found highly unusual as they would typically look away out of courtesy. Service aside, the udon truly was spectacular. It was thinner than the usual udon noodles but the al dente texture and the way it mixed in with the sauce was fantastic. I got the jaja cold soba and the heat of the spicy miso pork offset the cold noodles perfectly.

We ordered these two: - Tantan - the broth was so flavorful and the noodles, perfectly chewy. Youll wish your mouth was bigger so you can eat more at once. - Wagyu - the Wagyu was tender and the noodles in this dish were amazing, a little thicker than the tantan. The broth was also unbelievably delicious and not too salty. In addition to the noodles, we ordered the karage chicken, edamame and pork gyoza. Next time well save our stomachs and just order the noodles because the bowls are huge and we only managed to get halfway through them. We were so sad that we were too full to finish.

I would ve preferred if it came raw and I can dip in the hot broth myself, like the Vietnamese Pho, so I know it is indeed the A5 marbling piece of meat.

Raku feels more refined given that it s a full service place (even during covid) and it is noteworthy how bouncy the texture of the udon is. I got the gyunan which is a clear beef broth with thinly sliced beef. I also added the mochi topping to my udon and I loved it. The flavor is pretty neutral but it s chewy and soft and you get 2 hefty pieces which I thought was the perfect amount. Overall I enjoyed my udon but flavor-wise it wasn t mind blowing and I think it s expensive for udon. I also tried a few bites of the crab udon and wasn t impressed as it just tasted like egg drop soup and I feel like the viscosity makes it not a good pairing with udon.,3 years ago,2021-04-24 15:47:30.696788,,,,1,54,87,True,,

It is my name, and if I can spell Raku, a four-letter word, the restaurant should be able to get my name correctly. I felt disrespected. This was such a disappointing first interaction with the restaurant that I wanted to walk out, but my friend insisted on dining there, so we did. We ordered niku udon and oyaku don and both were delicious. We wanted Chawanmushi for appetisers, but the server told us the wait time is over 30 minutes.

The gyunan udon is my favorite by far as the rich soup is unbeatable.

Our reservation was 5:30 and we were kept waiting about 10 minutes or so. The booth was not ready for me to sit and I didnt like that the bathrooms were down a steep flight of steps. Anyone who is handicapped must avoid it. Next we ordered the meal. We were told the steak-dish  was already sold out and do keep in mind it was only 6:20. We had Chicken tatsuta-age, 6 fried chicken in a dish that came with a piece of lemon slice and very hot mayo. When I asked for more lemon... I actually got another small slice. For $8 give me LEMON! Next we got the big bowls of udon with a huge wooden spoon. The 3 bowls were NOT brought to the table at one time. The soup was good a bit to salty for my taste buds. The noodle texture was fresh and soft. Nameko Udon, Chicken Udon with  lots of dark meat which I am not fond of, and Udon with fried shrimp that was served on a plate so it didnt get soggy. I am also accustomed to taking my udon from the larger bowl into smaller bowls to make it easier to consume and I had to ask for BOWLS. The waiter returned with 1 bowl. Well, guess what He had to walk back with 2 more. Is it to hard for this waiter to be a tad more into his customers. He didnt introduce himself, we started with a waitress who never returned and it was like asking anyone who passed by for Service. My son totally told the waiter it was my birthday and to serve the desert with a candle. Well, they handed us the bill without even asking if we wanted anything else. My son-- gave the waiter a stare-- which I didnt understand and asked for the desert list. Well $10 later getting this cake with whisky ice cream, there was no Candle and he was very very disappointed. Food was fine. But for $70 worth of food I didnt like the service.

I remember rushing down Macdougal street a few months ago and halting abruptly when I saw the exterior of Raku for the first time. It looks like an oasis, and I longed to step in. When I saw that the specialty is udon, I immediately added it to my mental wishlist. Well, my wish came true, and it was everything I hoped it would be and more. We had a reservation for 6pm and we were seated immediately close to the window. The service was impeccable, and the server diligently explained all of the popular favorites. There are lots of vegetarian options, and they can even alter the udon broth to make it vegan. We wanted to order EVERYTHING. The tuna tartare with quail egg appetizer was so tender, we were amazed. (Fair warning that the egg is raw.) The vegetable gyoza were perfectly pan fried, not too oily. The cadence/speed at which the food came out was phenomenal. We were very hungry, and the servers watched us carefully to pace the food. Because J is pescatarian, we ordered the vegetable tempura udon and the eel donburi. The donburi was by far the standout. INCREDIBLY flavorful, with a fluffy egg concoction woven around the delicious eel. Rice was moist and perfect. Udon broth is sweet, and adding the spice mixture creates the umami. We added nameko mushrooms, poached egg, and mochi. I honestly cant imagine a better dinner. The portions are very generous, and the service has such attention to detail. They made sure we had all the proper sharing bowls and utensils ahead of time. The ambiance manages to find a balance between bustling, peaceful, and unpretentious. Our leftovers were boxed up neatly, and we never felt rushed even though there was a line waiting for tables. I am just so impressed and I cant wait to come back. Thank you, Raku, for a flawless experience, udon even know how much we enjoyed it.",5 years ago,2019-04-24 15:47:53.902695,,,,0,4,1,False,,

I have been to the original location once and craved their delicious udon for a month since going. Was super excited to go to Raku with my friend, this time trying out their new location. We went for lunch, around 1:30 and were seated promptly. Service is attentive and friendly. The new location is much more roomy and airy, tables are spaced out from each other and not crowded. Its much quieter as well, and more relaxed. At the original location I felt I had to eat pretty quickly because the tables turnover frequently, but at this location I could take my time and eat at my own pace. Decor is minimalist but contemporary with a lot of off white and light, natural wood. There are two bathrooms located downstairs. We ordered a bowl of udon each, I ordered the chikara udon (chicken, negi, and mochi) with an add on poached egg. My friend got the sansai (mountain vegetable) udon. The udon here is so good. I have visited Udon Maruka in Japan and its better here at Raku. The noodles have a luscious chew and are very smooth! The broth and meat are good as well, but the noodles... are the star of the show. The broth is delicious though too. I enjoy steaming my face in the large bowl before I dig in. The price is reasonable for what you get. The serving size is very generous and will fill you up. The food itself is pretty easy to digest and light, theres just a lot of it. Very satisfying meal. 10/10 would come back again. Raku is amazing! Best udon place I have tried! Ive been telling basically everyone I know about this place!

We were 5, and it was the first time for us to eat in Raku. We all had the noodle with soup. The warm soup noodles were the best choice because it was a cold day. The texture of the noodles was incredible. I have never eaten the noodles with this chewy texture. What a soup base it is! The warm and deep-tasted soup was delicious and made my stomach comfortable. So, I could give five stars for the food. However, I would rate the service only one star. When my mother and I arrived, the server requested us to wait outside until the rest people came. As I said previously, it was one of the coldest days. Even though my companions arrived in 15 minutes, the cold kept us frozen. I couldn t understand why we had to stay outside, though some tables were vacant. Another thing I really upset about was the server s attitude. When my mother asked if the noodles she chose came with soup, the waitress looked dismissive and said harshly, Yes. My mother told me later that she was embarrassed. It might be a  ridiculous question if this restaurant had only noodles with soup. However, not everyone knows that; especially those coming for the first time, like us, definitely don t know it. Also, the server was responsible for explaining the menu and food. All the rates of the excellent food were written off with the rude attitude of the server. I am curious why noodle soups became a soul food in Japan and Korea. In Japanese cuisine, Ramen and Udon are traditional noodle soups among Japanese cuisine. So do Kalgugsu and Janchigugsu in Korean cuisine. Compared to Western food, Korea and Japan have developed a variety of soup dishes.

What s even more impressive is that they ve maintained the same quality over the years. It s gotten to the point that, when it comes to udon cravings, it s Raku or nothing. For first timers, I highly recommend the ebiten udon to get a taste of the restaurant s style. Eat the noodles one at a time. I jokingly describe it as savory boba. The udon has a supple, bouncy texture that can only come from being freshly made in-house. Most Japanese restaurants that serve udon but not exclusively udon use the frozen stuff in supermarkets. Raku is one of the few that make their own udon. It s not only the texture of the noodles: everything else is flawless. The broth is a perfect balance of fishy, salty, and sweet. Other restaurants Americanize the broth by making it too sweet; Raku s broth is the way it should be. The tempura is light and crisp without being oily. Any excess oil is absorbed by the paper it sits on. And, they provide umeboshi as a palate cleanser in between bites in case we are starting to get tired of the bowl of noodles. Raku offers vegetarian options, but the broth feels so unsatisfying in comparison that I d recommend a cold dipping udon.",9 months ago,2023-07-24 15:48:04.289874,,,,6,276,1100,True,,

Whether you want a light or rich soup here, the ingredients in the noodles are also very sincere. What is even more must-order is definitely the fried tofu.

The food was incredibly disappointing. The udon noodles were thick and unappetizing, bearing no resemblance to authentic Japanese cuisine. To make matters worse, they were served with subpar crab meat that my dog wouldnt even eat, all for the outrageous price of $26.

The Niku is the most popular which is beef short rib with tripe. There are generous amounts of meat. We also had the eggplant appetizer which was excellent, it has a raw quail egg on top with a spicy ground meat topping reminiscent of Chinese dan dan noodle meat. Service was friendly, very fast and efficient. For all those that complain about the service in other reviews, they probably dont understand that this is a busy place and customers should be respectful of others waiting to come in. If thats a problem for you and you want to just sit around, Id suggest you find another place to eat, or leave after eating and go to any of the hundreds of bars in the area to chat and hang out. The food is outstanding. Let others enjoy it too. Other tips: - You can check in and queue up on yelp prior to coming and it will hold a spot for you in line. - This is a CASH ONLY place. They have a hidden atm in the back but probably better to just bring cash. - There isnt a place for you to wait for your table, so plan accordingly.",4 years ago,2020-04-24 15:48:28.372554,,,,3,83,2160,True,,

Appetizers: We ordered two appetizers, the chicken tatsuta-age and the Ankimo (monk fish liver). To start, the chicken was incredible. The sauce was a bit spicy and a bit sour, but complemented the chicken well. The chicken was breaded to perfection and cooked perfectly. The meat was very tender and crispy at the same time. To be frank, the Ankimo was a bit average. I never really had it before and wanted to try it, but I felt it was pretty bland. With that being said, it couldve been the best monk fish liver in the world and I probably wouldnt have tasted the difference. Onto the udon! Unlike most people on Yelp, I actually got the Curry Udon with beef instead of the Niku Udon (not a big fan of tripe and a big fan of curry). The broth was delicious and you could tell they really put a lot of love in there. The noodles were incredibly stringing but silky and the same time. Easily slurp-able! The beef was pretty tender and was a good addition to the dish. And portion size? It was a massive portion size (and I think I could eat a fair amount). Because I hate myself, I drank all the broth despite increasingly alarming protests from my stomach. My friend and I both had to walk around the block a few times afterwards because we felt we were about to explode. NO regrets on downing the whole dish. Overall, this was a very delicious bowl of udon, especially coming from a non-udon eater.",5 years ago,2019-04-24 15:48:42.386776,,,,1,123,127,True,,

I talked and thought about this udon for like a month, I wouldn t shut up about it. The noodles are really special and the broth and other ingredients go so well together. The portion is huge but you don t feel gross after eating it - even though it s udon I find it doesn t weigh me down afterwards which is VERY interesting. I d also like to mention that I m gluten sensitive and their noodles don t upset my stomach (but of course if you have food allergies, take this with a grain of salt). I love the dishware it comes in as well; huge open bowl that you can basically steam your face over it! However, the downside of this location is that it s extremely small and cramped.

Originally, we were planning on hitting up Sobaya but after a delightful matcha tasting at Setsugekka, we decided to ask for recommendations of their favorite restaurants. They told us of Raku, just a block away, and we decided to be adventurous and try it. Thank goodness we did, because I was blown away at how delicious the udon noodle soup is here. Although very tempted to try the popular Niku udon here, I ultimately opted for the Gyunan udon ($17) and added a poached egg to my order. The Gyunan udon has Washugyu beef, which is a cross between angus and wagyu beef. The bowls are pretty big here, and the aroma that wafts towards you as the server places the bowl down in front of you is intoxicating. My bowl of Gyunan also came with negi, which is Japanese green onion. What really sets Raku apart is the quality of their noodles. These noodles expertly soak up every flavor of the meat and broth. Theyre neither too firm nor too chewy, and the smoothness and slightly wider width of the noodles makes it the perfect candidate for successful udon. The broth is also wonderful. Beef broths in general are some of my weaknesses, and I love how this broth was not salty nor too fatty. You can add other toppings like spicy miso pork, tempura, umeboshi, oroshi, wakame, spinach, mochi, etc. Most toppings are between a $1-6 add-on. CASH ONLY but oh so worth it.

We were seated right away. Everyone that works there was so polite and friendly. We ordered the Atsugiri bacon.. it looked like bacon but tasted like heavenly pork belly. It was rich but doenst have a strong smoky flavor that bacon does. It was just amazing! Then I ordered the niku and my bf ordered the curry with beef. The soup to the Niku was light and flavorful. Tastes like homemade soup that grandma makes. It is rich. The curry had a good balance of heat. They were so thoughtful that they brought him a glass of ice water just in case it was too spicy.  The noodles were amazing. Nice texture (good chew) and it sopped up the soup so well. Every bite was satisfying.,6 years ago,2018-04-24 15:48:48.131395,,,,0,63,284,True,,

They do have an ATM inside in case you forgot. The entrance is inconspicuous but if you see a doorway that doesnt have a sign and has a Japanese feel, that just might be it! More details: The Niku Udon is what raku is most known for and for a good reason! The soup is very flavorful and the tripe is really tender. Unlike a lot of the tripe dishes in the US, that tends to make tripe too chewy that its hard to break it apart, raku makes it perfectly.
