There are also alcohol/non-alcoholic drinks to go along with your meal. Price range for small appetizers: $4-7, lunch/dinner combo: $6-$12. There are at least 20-30 varieties daily with some seasonal menu items. I was delighted to find the Stir fried octopus with kimchee fried rice. True enough it tasted even better than it look. The octopus was so tender and flavorful. I also bought the spicy pork. It was very tasty but a bit too salty for me. The garlic fried chicken was good but I wish it was less oily. During my visit I noticed the staff regularly sanitize dining tables and seats for the diners. Kudos to the management for ensuring a safe and hygienic environment for everyone visiting! Its an eye opener seeing prepared food constantly strolled on a cart every few minutes from the kitchens doorway to the display rack. The kitchen staff here definitely can cook up a storm of Korean food. My family and I have been coming here for more than a decade.

This place is very local so expect the kids coming out of school to head here or those coming out of work as well. If you ever need to get something to eat but dont want to sit down and be served, this is the perfect place for you! The Food does change everyday, and by the hour due to temperature danger zones. So expect something different from morning to night. Woorijip is a cafeteria type of establishment; you pick a tray and load it up with all the goodies your soul and wallet desire. Once done, you could either dine in after paying and heat up the food in their microwave or take out and enjoy it on your couch! If you pay cash, they do currently offer a discount, so I highly suggest doing so! If I lived in Manhattan, I would go here everyday lol. But I do come here at least once a month now!  Bring your closest homies and come here after your early Karaoke session :) Vegetarian options: Items like bok choy and miso soup! Kid-friendliness: Drinks and food the kids would enjoy!

This is a pick up pre-made food restaurant, take it home or show your vaxx card and eat in place. We paid our premade food that was in plastic and sat down to enjoy. Some guy came over and asked for money with, not just one meal, but like 5+ meals in his carton. Although we felt bad, we said no, sorry, we cant help you. The guy went and consulted with management. He came back more aggressive, ready to assault us, took off his mask, as though ready to threaten us with his potential virus: Buy my food or Ill give you covid: and started singing the National Anthem. One could see him performing for money, but obviously it was: I will annoy and bother you until you give me money, in fact, and I will make you sick if I have to. I signaled the staff: Get this guy out of here. They ignored me. I told him off, he told me CAN I HELP YOU? No, Im not going to fight you with my 5 and 6 year old nephews here, go away. We cant help you, idiot. He went back to talking to the owners, who seemingly were in the know, and had told him to come get money from us. The owners should have had this guy out in 5 minutes or less, but instead seemed to support this idiot trying to fight and assault us, and our young children. I would think any business in NYC would be prepared to eject these people, not support them assaulting their customers.

Found this spot years ago in high school and I will always come back for fast and cheap Korean food. Sometimes I bring my friends here and theyre amazed by the price and the quality. Its a great spot to grab something fast late night, for lunch or dinner. Theyre generally very fast at the register line and even created two separate lines. One for cash and one for credit card. During Friday and Saturday nights as well as lunch time, theres usually a long line. If you cant find seating, theres always the parks outside you can sit at and enjoy the busy streets of the city. I usually get the prepacked food and usually get anything with bulgogi or the chapchae (spelling? Its the clear noodles). The portions are always large. Sometimes I get the rolls, which are also great. Some meals come with a free soup, salad or water bottle. You have to check if it has the sticker on it. You can also get food by the pounds if you really feel like eating a variety. They have a large drink selection, including alcohol. Just got to remember that you can drink it inside, but not outside. They have a rewards card system and with enough stamps you can get a free package of ramen or seaweed.

I wanted a quick grab and go and I was on 23rd and Madison with my baby but decided I was feeling for some tasty korean food so I walked to this place from Madison. I get there and as Im looking at the options to eat I was asked to either LEAVE or fold the stroller and leave it in the back....my baby was asleep. We were at Madison Square park playing for over a hour and I tired him out and he fell asleep on the walk from 23 to 34. I explained that I wasnt staying that I just wanted to grab something and go but was repeated the same thing again. The place was not packed and this has always been my go to spot when I feel like having fast Korean food but yeah not the most pleasant experience.,4 years ago,2020-04-24 16:09:10.057477,,,,7,67,12,True,,

They also have some more familiar items like fried rice and garlic chicken. They have trays and containers that are weighed by the lb.
